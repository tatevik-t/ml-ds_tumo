Given some *attributes* (also called *features*) of an unseen example, it decides whether that example belongs to one or the other of two categories based on its similarity to previously seen examples. Predicting the category of an example is called *labeling*, and the predicted category is also called a *label*."

    "\n",
    "In k-NN, we classify a movie by finding the `k` movies in the *training set* that are most similar according to the features we choose. We call those movies with similar features the *nearest neighbors*.  The k-NN algorithm assigns the movie to the most common category among its `k` nearest neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's limit ourselves to just 2 features for now, so we can plot each movie.  The features we will use are the proportions of the words \"money\" and \"feel\" in the movie.  Taking the movie \"Batman Returns\" (in the test set), 0.000502 of its words are \"money\" and 0.004016 are \"feel\". This movie appears in the test set, so let's imagine that we don't yet know its genre.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to make our notion of similarity more precise.  We will say that the *distance* between two movies is the straight-line distance between them when we plot their features in a scatter diagram. This distance is called the Euclidean distance, whose formula is $\\sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the movie *Titanic* (in the training set), 0.0009768 of all the words in the movie are \"money\" and 0.0017094 are \"feel\".  Its distance from *Batman Returns* on this 2-word feature set is $\\sqrt{(0.000502 - 0.0009768)^2 + (0.004016 - 0.0017094)^2} \\approx 0.00235496$.  (If we included more or different features, the distance could be different.)\n",
    "\n",
    "A third movie, *The Avengers* (in the training set), is 0 \"money\" and 0.001115 \"feel\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The function below creates a plot to display the \"money\" and \"feel\" features of a test movie and some training movies. As you can see in the result, *Batman Returns* is more similar to *Titanic* than to *The Avengers* based on these features. However, we know that *Batman Returns* and *The Avengers* are both action movies, so intuitively we'd expect them to be more similar. Unfortunately, that isn't always the case. We'll discuss this more later."
