 <P class=arial style=""MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"">It would be much more useful to the industry, if SPFA would help find a ""CODE CONFORMING"" fire barrier for attics, crawl spaces etc., than&nbsp; lecture on Fast and Loose applications of code.&nbsp; Something about 30 cents (a BD. FT.) installed, meeting All codes and spray applied. Many companies we talk to have a product that appears to be perfect BUT they haven't spent the money to test over foam. Maybe a small committee could do a evaluation of various products, report results to SPFA, who in turn will ""acquire funding"" from US.</P>

 <P class=arial style=""MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"">#136-6 Mark W, South Carolina</P>
 <P class=arial style=""MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"">I'm sick of all this garbage about covering foam with a ""thermal Barrier"". What the hell do you think foam is? If you are saying that anything that can be FORCED to burn should be covered with a FIREPROOF barrier, then you'd better get busy covering all those trusses and joists and plywood up there that are definitely NOT carrying a class one fire rating. This double standard for foam is coming directly from those who stand to lose business from it. Icynene is DIFFERENT.&nbsp; IT DOESN'T BURN ALONE. IT DOESN'T MELT. IT DOESN'T EMIT PHOSGENE. Does it smoke in a fire situation? Sure, so what?</P>
 <P class=arial style=""MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt""><BR>Blaming foam in the attic for a house fire because it forces the foam to eventually burn is about as stupid as blaming foam seat cushions for burning when a gas tank ruptures and burns up a car. Get real, inspectors. You want us to cover up the only thing in the attic assembly that DOESN'T BURN!<BR>&nbsp;</P>
 <P class=arial style=""MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"">As for the vaunted R rating system, IT IS TOTALLY BOGUS. The test is designed to make porous insulations APPEAR to perform better than they actually do.&nbsp; Measuring only conduction and ignoring convection and radiant to convective transfer, the test should have been thrown out for the industry lackey it is 20 years ago, along with that obsolete fiberglass<BR>garbage they're still selling everybody.&nbsp; There's a reason they don't make refrigerators, freezers coolers &amp; coffee cups out of fiberglass or cellulose.&nbsp;&nbsp; Think about it.</P>

 <P class=arial style=""MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"">Thank you, Mark and Dik, for your statements above. I also feel that far too often individuals and companies are too complacent and quietly live with rules and regulations without trying to change them&nbsp; -&nbsp; even if everybody knows they do not make sense. We are all experts and representatives of this industry and should speak up and promote change!</P>

We compare standardized insulation to Ceramic coatings via BTU loss calculations.&nbsp; Depending on the criteria we can equal 2 to 3 inches of standard insulation with an aluminum jacket.&nbsp; We have the data and the projects to prove it.</FONT><BR>&nbsp;</FONT> </DIV>

","OFFICE OF:EGNR. FEMI DANIEL
 FEDERAL MINISTRY OF WORKS AND HOUSING
 FEDERAL SECRETARIAT OFFICE COMPLEX
 IKOYI-LAGOS.
 
 ATTN:,                  
 
 First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction, this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret as you were introduced to me in confidence through the Nigeria Chamber of Commerce and Industries.
 
 We are top officials from the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing,(FMW&H), Federal Ministry of Finance and the Presidency, making up the Contract Review Panel(CRP) set up by the Federal Government of Nigeria to review contracts awarded by the past military administration. 
 
 In the course of our work on the CRP, we discovered this fund which resulted from grossly over - invoiced contracts which were executed for the FMW&H during the last administration.The companies that executed the contracts have been duly paid and the contracts commissioned leaving the sum of US$21.4 Million floating in the escrow account of the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for payment.
 
 I have therefore  been mandated as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel to look for an overseas partner to whom we could transfer the sum of US21.4 legally subcontracting the entitlement to your company.This is bearing in mind that our civil service code of conduct forbids us from owning foreign companies or operating foreign accounts while in government service, hence the need for an overseas partner.
 
 We have agreed that the funds will be shared thus after it has been paid into your account.
 (1) 30% of the money will go to you for acting as the beneficiary of the fund.
 (2) 10% has been set aside as an abstract projection for reimbursement to both parties for incidental expences that may be incurred in the course of the transaction.
 (3) 60% to us the government officials (with which we intend to commence an importation business in conjunction with you)
 
 All logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for the smooth conclusion of the transaction within ten to fourteen days of commencement after receipt of the following information; your full names, company's name, address,details & activities, telephone & fax numbers.These information will enable us make the applications and lodge claims to the concerned ministries & agencies in favour of your company and it is pertinent to state here that this transaction is entirely based on trust as the solar bank draft or certified cheque drawable in any of the Central Bank of Nigeria correspondent bankers around the world is going to be made in your name.
 
 Please acknowledge the reciept of this letter using the above e-mail or the Alternative: femi1855@aol.com to reply me. 
 
 Yours faithfully,
 
 Egnr. Femi Daniel.
 
 NB:Bank Account Details not necessary as preferred mode of payment is by draft or cheque.

 The tacit acknowledgement and self-limiting you speak of is not a given
 or a function of 'sophistication' but is primarily a feature of
 (current) Western Civilization.  Of course, 'sophisticated' and 'Western
 Civilization' are essentially equivalent IMHO.  But it need not be so.

 And sometimes the religious component is a faade for an equally
 dangerous ethnic affiliation.  Hindu extremism isn't about the Hindu
 religious theology as far as I can see.  It is a peg to hang an ethnic
 identity and identity politics on.
 
 Muslim extremism appears to have a far greater connection to theology.

 Yep, all because the Scots ate oats and starved their Irish out long
 ago, while the English preferred wheat and that doesn't grow so well in
 Ireland.  That and the introduction of potatoes saved the Irish as
 Irish.

 Oh, I think we are in a war with wide aspects of the Muslim religion.  I
 know it is there, but it just might not be appropriate to admit it
 publicly.

 I didn't say this was a *good* thing.  With the exception of ethnic
 restaurants, I can generally be counted on to oppose anything labeled
 'multi-cultural'.

 Yeah, that's exactly what I was doing--I didn't realize I was incurring
 administrative pickle bloat this way.  I'm specifically trying to make
 things faster and smaller, so I'm storing individual WordInfo pickles
 into an anydbm dict (keyed by token).  The result is that it's almost 50
 times faster to score messages one per run our of procmail (.408s vs
 18.851s).
 
 However, it *does* say all over the place that the goal of this project
 isn't to make the fastest or the smallest implementation, so I guess
 I'll hold off doing any further performance tuning until the goal starts
 to point more in that direction.  .4 seconds is probably fast enough for
 people to use it in their procmailrc, which is what I was after.

 That's probably what I'll do if I get too antsy :)

 It sounds more like you're looking for a commercial service, in which

 It'll do that and a lot more.

 As I'd written the code a few months ago, we were reading the sequences file 
 first to see what sequences were in it and then once per sequence.  This 
 happens anywhere that we look at sequences, most notably in Ftoc_ShowSequences.
 That seemed to be an obvious lose performancewise, but I wanted my abstraction to 
 have a separate call for ""what sequences are in this folder?"" and ""what 
 messages are in this sequence?"".  One option would have been to add another 
 call to get the data off of disk, but I felt that the check-the-modify-time 
 technique would be less error-prone.
 
 I think the biggest gains would be from augmenting Ftoc_ShowSequences to allow 
 a finer specification of what needs to be updated in the ftoc so that the 
 current code would only be run when we really do have to update all sequences 
 for all messages.  I described these thoughts in an email message yesterday.
 
 And again, if it can wait a few weeks, I'm willing to do it.

 What does that exactly have to do with the statement that
 distruption of peacable political assembly has become
 a common practice disruption tool?  It's an observation
 not a judgement, comment, approval.  You've focused on the
 word ""muddy"" to use it in a different context than the one
 I posted.
 
 Maybe the distinction I was trying to make was too subtle and
 I was trying to be too clever with my writing this morning.
 Let me summarize the important parts of my post for you: I
 have a premise that there is a difference between free and protected
 speech and action.  I think O'Neill on his soapbox doesn't
 understand the distinction.

"Subject: [zzzzteana] Plumstead Panther - Pictures!
","Looks and sounds a hell of a lot like Clare's cat, Violence...
 
 A tall tail or is it a prowling panther?
 
 
 http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/news/weird/display.var.633939.Bizarre+London.0.html
 
 
 Security cameras at the Gardiner house filmed the cat
 The Plumstead panther has been spotted just yards from the scene of a 
 sighting made three weeks ago but this time it was caught on camera.
 
 Steve Gardiner, 41, claims to have spotted the large cat in his garden in 
 Upton Road, Plumstead, in the sixth reported sighting in Woolwich and Bexley 
 in just four weeks.
 
 Mr Gardiner told News Shopper he watched the big cat as it walked alongside 
 the house at about 7.15am, on Wednesday, September 25, while his security 
 cameras captured it on film.
 
 The father-of-four described the black cat as about 3ft long and 
 two-and-a-half-foot high, with a large body.
 
 He said: ""It prowled past the patio doors moving with all the mannerisms of 
 a hunter.
 
 ""It looked at me calmly before moving on.""
 
 The bricklayer told how his work colleagues let him know News Shopper had 
 been following the big cat story so he decided to call our offices with news 
 of the sighting.
 
 His wife, Karen, 41, later checked the tape which had captured grainy images 
 of the large cat prowling through their garden.
 
 She said: ""I feel sorry for it not living in its natural habitat I'd hate 
 for it to get hurt.""
 
 Mr Gardiner told how he is convinced of the cat's existence saying how their 
 usually quiet 18-year-old dog barks at ""nothing"" in the garden but barked 
 that morning.
 
 He warned: ""I don't think these cats are dangerous but, if cornered, they 
 might jump you.""
 
 Sightings of the large black cat are being reported all over the Plumstead 
 Common and Shooters Hill as well at the Bexley area.
 
 If you have seen the big cat, call News Shopper on 01689 885712.

"Subject: Kill Your Gods
","Hindus mourn 'monkey god'
 
 
 By Omer Farooq
 BBC reporter in Hyderabad
 
 Hundreds of people have attended the funeral of a monkey which became
 revered as a divine incarnation of a Hindu god in the southern Indian
 state of Andhra Pradesh.
 
 
 The monkey was quite old and both its hind legs were paralysed
 
 Animal rights campaigners say the monkey died of starvation and exhaustion
 after being trapped in a temple for a month by over-zealous worshippers.
 
 The animal was cremated in Anantapur district, 400 kilometres (250 miles)
 south of the state capital, Hyderabad, on Sunday.
 
 It had not eaten for three weeks.
 
 Last rites were performed by priests in the village of Timmiganipally in
 the presence of hundreds of devotees who had come to believe that the
 monkey was a reincarnation of the Hindu monkey god, Hanuman.
 
 Garlanded
 
 One animal rights activist said his group's efforts to save the monkey had
 failed because of the blind faith of the people.
 
 
 The monkey's death came a day after he and others tried to move the animal
 out of the temple, but were prevented by villagers.
 
 The monkey, which was found perched on top of an idol of Hanuman a month
 ago, attracted hundreds of devotees every day from surrounding villages,
 as well as from the neighbouring state of Karnataka.
 
 Devotees showered the monkey with fruit and flowers and worshipped it
 around the clock.
 
 'Exploited'
 
 Locals said they believed that Lord Hanuman was visiting the village, as
 the temple had stopped daily rituals after a dispute between two groups of
 residents.
 
 But animal rights campaigners complained that the animal was being
 mistreated.
 
 They filed a petition in the state's High Court saying the monkey had been
 forcibly confined in the temple.
 
 The group also alleged that people's religious feelings were being
 exploited to make money.
 
 The court then ordered the local administration to rescue the monkey - but
 villagers prevented officials from taking him for treatment in time.",0,,,,

"Subject: Record industry defends practices to Senate
","URL: http://boingboing.net/#85513221
 Date: Not supplied
 
 The Joint Hearing of the Senate Committee and Senate Select Committee on the 
 Entertainment Industry is underway in LA, investigating artists' claims that 
 the labels engage in unfair and corrupt business-practices. The first day's 
 findings at the hearings are really quite remarkable: 
 
     By contract, artists are prohibited from showing royalty statements to 
     third parties. Normally this would not include their mangers, lawyers, 
     consultants, or others who could aid them in getting paid, but apparently 
     this is not necessarily the case. Senator Kevin Murray, leading the 
     initiative for artists' rights, claimed the that Cary Sherman, Chief 
     Counsel for the RIAA himself, said to him in an interview, that RIAA 
     members (the major labels) would sue any artist that broke ranks and shared 
     information with the Committee. This claim was rejected by Sherman but 
     supported by others in the room. Don Henley, among them, outwardly dared 
     his record company to sue him for bringing royalty statements to the 
     hearing. He presented his most recent royalty statement for ""Hell Freezes 
     Over,"" which showed the panel that even though his contract called for a no 
     more than a 10% ""reserve"" on sales of records shipped, Universal Music had 
     held back more than that for eleven pay periods (roughly under three years) 
     and that, even though his contract calls for no free goods in Europe, they 
     had deducted $87,000 in free goods charges to Europe.

 Let's face it, New Year's resolutions are mostly nightmares that 
 hang over our heads like that dark cloud that follows Eeyore 
 everywhere he goes. We mostly fail to keep our resolutions 
 because they are too vague and imply guilt-inducing judgment. 1. 
 Live every moment. 2. Be a good person. 3. Lose a lot of weight. 
 No pressure. Right? Wrong.

 Don't despair. We've put together a quick, proactive to-do list 
 that is actually doable. This year's resolution: Save big bucks 
 now and live comfortably in the future. Now that's a resolution 
 you can get behind. Let's get started! 
 
 1. DIAL AWAY YOUR DEBT 
 It's true. You can lower your credit card interest rates with

 SPOTLIGHT
 
 SHOULD ALL MY SAVINGS BE IN THE MARKET?
 Um, no. 
 
 We are big supporters of the idea that all of your long-term 
 money should be in the stock market. But over the short term, 
 the market is too volatile. Buying stocks for short-term gain is 
 really speculating, not investing. Would you have wanted to have 
 your emergency fund, or your house down payment, or your kid's 
 tuition in the Nasdaq at its height on March 10, 2000? If you 
 can't afford or wait out a 30% drop in the value of your 
 savings, keep it out of the market.
 
 Of course, we're not just going to leave you hanging. To figure 
 out the best place to keep your short-term savings, visit our 
 nifty Savings Center.

 COMMUNITY TIPS
 
 DO (AT LEAST) ONE THING DIFFERENTLY
 Folks on the Living Below Your Means discussion board have been 
 sharing at least one thing they are going to do differently in 
 2002 to save money. 
 
 -I am going to make sure I carry my coupon envelope in my purse 
  so I don't find myself at the grocery store buying a bunch of 
  stuff on which I could save a bunch of money if I hadn't left my 
  coupons at home. 
 
 -Make sure I get reimbursed for every dime my company owes me. I 
  have a bad habit of not filing expense reports for little stuff, 
  like 10 miles of mileage to go to a mediation. Ten miles is 
  $3.10 and if I do that 10 times a year, that's more than 30 
  bucks, and definitely worth filing an expense report for. 
 
 -I'm going to make at least one crock-pot meal a week so I don't 
  get tempted to go out and buy something to eat. Fridays would be 
  a great time to do this. 
 
 -Either cut down on the long-distance phone calls, or else find 
  a cheaper long-distance plan.
 
 -Document everything that I give to charity, including the 
  clothes and books, so that I can deduct it from my taxes. 
 
 -Keep turning down the thermostat at night and when I leave the 
  house. Run my humidifier (moist air is cheaper to heat). 
 
 Have any tips of your own? Add to the growing list here.

 Funny as all hell.  So a group of 25 QUIT (Queers Undermining Israeli
 Terrorism) marched into the local starbucks in Berkeley (Of course,
 they pick a safe city like Berkeley, but hey, still funny) and
 'settle' driving away straights and other prior inhabitants with
 supersoakers :)
 
 Incredibly creative, in my opinion. Not terribly violent (I mean, how
 much damage can you -really-  do with a supersoaker?) but definintely
 a newscatcher.
 
 Its nice to see folks are finding some creative means to make a point.
  Even if you don't -agree- with it, its a hard sell to say that this

 My laptop has a Via C3 processor. I use Debian with a self-compiled
 2.4.19 kernel, and have had absolutely no problems with the chip at all
 (quite the opposite, in fact).
 
 I had to compile for ""686"" in order for 3D acceleration to work (the
 kernel has an option specifically for the Via C3), but I assume that was
 a kernel problem rather than a hardware problem.

 This is true...it's now looking at more than just unseen, so it takes a little 
 while (in the background) to build the sequences window.  There is probably 
 some tuning possible in this area.

 I changed the default display of unseen messages from a foreground of blue to 
 a background of white to make it possible to see what other sequences unseen 
 messages may be in.  I *did* ask Brent before I did it.  If you like the old 
 behavior, the old lines are still in app-defaults-color, but commented out.

 This is because of your Hook_MsgShow_update_unseen which is calling a function 
 which no longer exists.
 
 I suspect you need
 	Seq_Del $exmh(folder) unseen $msgid
 now instead of 
 	Mh_MarkSeen $exmh(folder) $msgid

 As long as the OS doesn't give you a convenient GetPassPhrase() method 
 that threat model is theoretical. Worms are autonomous, and autonomous 
 worms are not that smart.
 
 However, that's the reason I mentioned crypto hardware (USB fobs, smart

 While this is a good idea, the concept of security is holistic. It 
 involves a secure OS, secure apps, and crypto hardware.

 I believe I mentioned users can't be bothered to enter passphrases. That's
 what tokens are there for. At some point we can expect a convenient USB
 port on the keyboard, or the video device front. Meanwhile, my Net PC 
 server sitting by the CRT with front USB ports will do.

 Don't worry about the warnings. To fix the error, edit spamc.c and right 
 after the line that says:
 
 #define EX__MAX 77
 
 Add:
 
 #if !defined __osf__
 extern char *optarg;
 typedef unsigned long   in_addr_t;      /* base type for internet address */
 #endif
 
 (you're adding the two lines that start with #).

 Years ago, there was a package called mh-e which was an emacs interface

 family so talk amongst yourself..here Ill give you a topic
 
 The current state of IT can be thought of in terms of the Cold war with
 the US and the UUSR being MS and Sun/IBM/OSS (does it matter which side
 is which?), Apple as Cuba and the US legal system as the UN.
 
 Discuss.

 I simply put it (them) into my (nmh) component files (components,
 replcomps, forwcomps and so on).  That way you get them when you are
 editing your message.  Also, by using comps files for specific
 folders you can alter your .sig per folder (and other tricks).  See
 the docs for (n)mh for all the details.
 
 There might (must?) also be a way to get sedit to do it, but I've
 been using gvim as my exmh message editor for a long time now.  I
 load it with a command that loads some email-specific settings, eg,
 to ""syntax"" colour-highlight the headers and quoted parts of an
 email)... it would be possible to map some (vim) keys that would add
 a sig (or even give a selection of sigs to choose from).
 
 And there are all sorts of ways to have randomly-chosen sigs...
 somewhere at rtfm.mit.edu... ok, here we go:
 rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet-by-group/news.answers/signature_finger_faq.
 (Warning... it's old, May 1995).

","http://yorkshirepost.co.uk/scripts/editorial2.cgi?cid=news&aid=481687
 
 2.5ft lizard 'abandoned' at resort
 
 Holidaymakers at a seaside resort were stunned to find a 2.5ft lizard
 sunning itself at a caravan park close to a beach.
 The savannah monitor lizard was captured at Chapel St Leonards, Lincs, on
 Sunday by a member of the public before being collected by an RSPCA team.
 RSPCA officer Justin Stubbs, who took the lizard to a specialist carer,
 said: ""Savannah monitors can give a nasty bite and we certainly wouldn't
 have wanted one loose in a busy holiday resort for long.""
 Officials believe the animal may have been abandoned by a private owner
 because it has not been reported missing.
 Savannah monitor lizards originate in Africa and are carnivorous, eating
 rats and small rodents. They can grow to 4ft in length.
 Anyone with information about the lizard can contact the RSPCA in confidence
 on 08705 555 999.

","This is a bit of a messy solution but might be useful -
 
 If you have an internal zip drive (not sure about external) and
 you bios supports using a zip as floppy drive, you could 
 use a bootable zip disk with all the relevant dos utils.

 Indeed, my usual login is ""dude"" (and has been since long before ""The Big
 Lebowsky"" came out ;-)), and it seems the some programs wrongly hard code
 my home directory when being compiled :-(
 For instance :
 
 [dude@python dude]$ strings /usr/bin/gentoo | grep dude
 /home/dude/
 [dude@python dude]$ strings /usr/bin/xine | grep dude
 /home/dude/redhat/tmp/xine-root/usr/share/locale
 
 These should probably be considered bugs in the program's build process
 (especially for xine, look at that!), I'll report them upstream if/when I
 have some time.
 
 Thanks for noticing this!

 Political mail (the snail kind) doesn't bother me.  I like it a lot of the 
 time, because as crap as it is at least it's not the kind of info you get 
 on TV.  Particularly for small time local politics, it's the best way to 
 get information.
 
 but what matters is that mail is speech, and political email has to be as
 well protected as any other political speech.  Spam is *the* tool for
 dissident news, since the face that it's unsolicited means that recipients
 can't be blamed for being on a mailing list.

 Well, why not try Linux on Sparc. It works pretty well and I have not had
 major issues with it. There are minor problems: like the serial console
 drivers, but for workstation installs I suspect it will work fine.
 
 And you get a working version of your favourite KDE/Gnome desktop instead of
 DTE, uhm, I mean CDE.

 Well, you have to add the workstation to the install server first.
 
 Talking of which, you can install Sparc Linux using this technique as well.
 The image takes a while to load, but once this is done you can install in
 the normal fashion.
 
 SuSe for Sparc works fine. I am using Debian because the Sun boxen I have
 subverted do not have graphics consoles. It also just works.
 
 If you have a spare workstation, I am sure I could burn a couple of CD's for
 you. (If I can find them.)

 Lagos, Nigeria.
 Dear Sir,
 
 IMPORTANT.
 
 After due deliberation with my colleagues, We have decided to forward to
 you this business proposal. We want a reliable 
 person who could assist us in the transfer the sum of Twenty Million, Five
 Hundred Thousand United States Dollars ( 
 $20,500,000 ). Via International Bank Draft Cashable in any First World
 Countries.
 
 This fund resulted from an over-invoiced bill from contracts awarded by us
 under the budget allocation to our Ministry. This 
 bill has been approved for payment by the other concerned Ministries. The
 contract has since been executed, 
 commissioned and the contractor was paid the actual cost of the contract.
 We are left with the balance US$20.5M as part 
 of the over-invoiced amount which we have deliberated over estimated for
 our own use. But under our protocol division, we 
 as civil servants are forbidden to operate or own foreign accounts. This
 is why we are soliciting your assistance in this 
 manner and regard .
 
 As you may want to know and to make you less curious, I got your address
 from adverts in the business directory . I am the 
 Chief Accountant/Internal Auditor of the Contract Award Committee ( CAC )
 of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation 
 ( NNPC). This transaction is very much free from all sorts of RISKS and
 TROUBLE from my Government. We the N.N.P.C. 
 Officials involved in this deal have put in many years in service to this
 Ministry. We have been exercising patience for this 
 opportunity for so long and to most of us this is a life time opportunity
 we cannot afford to miss.
 
 We have agreed to COMPENSATE you duly if agreement is reached by both of
 us and I and one of my colleagues 
 involved in this deal will come to your country to arrange for our share,
 upon the confirmation from you that the Certified 
 International Bank Draft has been Approved and Raised in your favor.
 
 Consequent upon your acceptance of this proposal, kindly confirm your
 interest by Telephone to me, through my Direct Tel 
 No: +873-762-692484. (Please Call Direct, DO NOT add my country(234) and
 City(1) codes ) . Your indication by revert 
 Telephone to me of your sincere and serious interest will enable me fax
 you or brief you of  the PROCEDURES FOR THIS 
 TRANSACTION. If my line is busy, please keep trying you will surely get
 through.
 NOTE: In the event of your inability to handle this transaction please
 inform us so that we can look for another reliable 
 person who can assist in this respect. 
 
 It might surprise you why we choose you and trusted you for this
 transaction. Yes, we believe that good friends can be 
 discovered and business like this can not be realized without mutual
 trust. This is why we have decided to trust you for this 
 transaction. Be further informed that everyones interest and
 security had been considered before you were contacted, so be rest assured
 and feel free to go into this transaction with 
 us.
 But let Honesty and Trust be our watchword throughout this transaction and
 your prompt reply will be highly appreciated. 
 Thank you, and God bless.

 Just one more info. I measured the time spent wrapping the stuff in 
 Ftoc_Next with time {} so the data is for real. One difference 
 between mine and Valdis' setup (judging from his trace) is that I use 
 the address book. I've been doing that for ages so that can't be the 
 problem.
 
 Is there a way to get the log to print time with higher granularity?

 Well, I don't really find it consistent at all to use an rpm package built
 against something that wasn't installed through rpm :-/
 
 What I'd recommend in your case : You should keep at least one original Red
 Hat Linux kernel (you do just in case, right? ;-)) and install the matching
 alsa-kernel package as you'll need at least one because of the
 dependencies. Then for your custom built kernel, simply ""./configure
 --with-cards=all && make && make install DESTDIR=/tmp/alsa-driver"" from the
 alsa-driver sources then as root copy all the modules under
 /tmp/alsa-driver/lib/modules/ to your modules dir and run ""depmod -a"".
 
 Of course you can even make it much faster by not compiling all un-needed
 drivers, as I guess that's one of the reasons one would rebuild his own
 kernel.
 
 I find this the easiest and cleanest way to get around the problem. It's
 what I've done and what I'll keep doing on my laptop where I'm running a
 kernel recompiled with ACPI.

 Ah, now I see. This is a non-issue here, so I'll rebuild locally :)

 Already the most prolific virus ever, Klez continues to wreak havoc.
 
 Andrew Brandt
 >>From the September 2002 issue of PC World magazine
 Posted Thursday, August 01, 2002
 
 
 The Klez worm is approaching its seventh month of wriggling across 
 the Web, making it one of the most persistent viruses ever. And 
 experts warn that it may be a harbinger of new viruses that use a 
 combination of pernicious approaches to go from PC to PC.
 
 Antivirus software makers Symantec and McAfee both report more than 
 2000 new infections daily, with no sign of letup at press time. The 
 British security firm MessageLabs estimates that 1 in every 300 
 e-mail messages holds a variation of the Klez virus, and says that 
 Klez has already surpassed last summer's SirCam as the most prolific 
 virus ever.
 
 And some newer Klez variants aren't merely nuisances--they can carry 
 other viruses in them that corrupt your data.

"Subject: [SAtalk] OT: DNS MX Record Clarification Please
","This may be a little off topic but thought people here would have a better
 response to this elsewhere.
 
 I have setup two MX records (mail and bmail) for my mail server. The one I
 gave a 10 (bmail) the other a 20 (mail).
 
 bmail(10) I gave a 10 because I want all mail to go through this server to
 be scanned for SPAM and viruses and then relayed to the mail(20) server for
 delivery.
 
 As I understand it, DNS A records are used in a rotating fashion for load
 balancing, but DNS MX records are used in order or prority, meaning the 10
 before the 20 and only 20 if the 10 isn't available.
 
 But only some of the mail is actually being scanned which leads me to
 believe that not all of the mail is actually hitting that box and the 10
 never goes down. Why? Have I got something confused here?

"Subject: Re: Lord of the Ringtones: Arbocks vs. Seelecks
","I got to see Powell talk in March 2001 at the beginning of his
 reign at the FCC.  He said they were going to take a real
 hands off approach, so it's funny that they would blame
 the regulators for causing the collapse.  One thing he did
 get right, is that he wasn't worried that the US was behind
 Europe in the wireless licensing spectrum.  This is something
 very prescient in that most of those licensors have had to
 eat their lunch over the huge licensing costs they paid for
 very little benefit.  His legacy was/is supposed to be
 rethinking the FCC's role to stay out of the way in this
 period of business innovation in the wireless space as he
 didn't want the government forcing business models onto
 the private sector.
 
 His full transcript is here [1].  Interestingly enough I
 got to see his speech in person as he was part of the whole
 CTIA'2001 Las Vegas keynote series of speakers.  Clay and
 I hoped a flight out of Ontario to Las Vegas to do demo support
 for Craig Barrett [2].  His message was that there's no difference
 between wired and wireless Internet--it's all the same thing.
 Instead of scalable networks, we should be thinking about scalable
 content (& using Magi he showed sending a blue man tv commercial
 from a desktop to a laptop to an ipaq to a color smartphone with
 the content scaling back for each target platform).
 
 The best part of the whole trip wasn't hobnobbing at all,
 but really the fact that the Venetian had ran out of rooms.
 They decided to put us up in one of their $10,000/night high
 roller rooms.  They put Clay in one and me in another.
 The Venetian is known for having the largest hotel rooms
 anywhere, but these ones were bigger than my whole house. 8-)

 In which world are we talking about?  That may be true for the first sale, 
 but once something is out in the world, the ""creator"" loses control... If I 
 buy a chair you built, and then decide to give it away to my neighbor, by 
 you're definition, he just stole from you.

 Why is it that people don't understand that giving stuff away is a 
 perfectly acceptable tactic in capitalist businesses?  In many places, it's 
 called ""advertising"": ""buy one, get one free"", ""free shipping on any order 
 over $25"", ""buy this couch, and get a coffee table for free"", ""free popcorn 
 with any movie rental"", ""free doorprize to the first 100 people who enter"", 
 ""the author will be signing books (for free) at such and such bookstore"".
 
 Access to free stuff often helps to sell other stuff.  Just because you 
 (and the entertainment industry, it seems) can't be creative enough to come 
 up with a business model to leverage free stuff into paid stuff... don't 
 take it out on the rest of us.

"Subject: Never Pay eBay Fees Again!!!!
","Hi,
 
 I'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  
 I'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over 
 $250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?
 
 In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret,
 it's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...
 
 You've probably heard stories about people making
 whopping huge money online, but you thought they 
 were the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or
 boy-geniuses.
 
 Well, grasshopper, think again ...
 
 It's people like you and me that are making the real
 money.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!
 
 Ever since the ""dot com bubble"" burst in 1999, small-time
 entrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 
 companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.
 
 Today small business owners and ordinary folks 
 like you and me can use the web to achieve complete 
 financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little 
 work.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing 
 technique ever created - it's called bulk email, or SPAM.
 
 If you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then 
 you know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on 
 DELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?
 You might not want their product, but remember that 
 thousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a 
 percentage game - every bulk emailer who contacts you 
 makes a six figure income on the Internet.  I 
 guarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and 
 review some numbers ...
 
 If you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a few
 dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one
 auction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a
 couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand
 over a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CAN
 SEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY
 at virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000
 emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.
 ZERO!
 
 Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when
 hardly anyone sees your ad!
 
 Imagine that you have a decent product with a 
 profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send 
 an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person 
 in a thousand actually places an order, then you just 
 generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours 
 of work.  
 
 It's that simple ...
 
 All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A
 THOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.
 
 The best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't 
 matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student 
 using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old 
 executive working from an office building in New 
 York City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start 
 bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All it takes 
 is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, and some 
 basic familiarity with the Internet.
 
 I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the 
 ""Dot Com"" mania, and I've never looked back.  I 
 started with no money, no product to sell, and only 
 the most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an 
 opportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, 
 I bought my own home - with CASH.  
 
 You don't need any money.  You don't need a product.
 You don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience
 whatsoever is required.  
 
 If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that
 you'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.
 So what are you waiting for?!
 
 I'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answer
 YES to all of them, then I can almost promise that you
 will make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.
 
 Here goes ...
 
 Do you have basic experience with the web? 
 Do you have a computer and an Internet connection?
 Do you have a few hours each day of free time?  
 Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards 
 complete financial freedom?  
 
 If you answer YES to these questions, you could be
 making $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your 
 home.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats 
 the 9-5 daily grind!
 
 All you need is ambition and commitment.  This
 is no ""get rich quick scheme"".  You have to work
 to make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do 
 it.
 
 You're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  
 Don't worry, it's not! I will show you step-by-step 
 how to start your first email campaign and how to
 build a booming online business.  You'll be generating 
 orders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.
 
 Okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?
 
 No problem!!  I'll show you where to find hot
 products that sell like CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delay
 starting an Internet business because they have 
 nothing to sell, but I'm removing that hurdle right now.  
 After reading the Spambook, you can build your complete 
 product line in less than two hours!  There is NO EXCUSE 
 not to get started! I will get you up-and-running within 
 seven days. In fact ...
 
 I personally guarantee that you will start your own 
 bulk email campaign less than a week after reading 
 the Spambook!  I'll give you a toll-free phone number 
 to reach me 24 hours a day, seven days a week; 
 where else will you find that level of service?!
 
 I will also include a step-by-step guide to starting 
 your very first email campaign called ""Seven Days to 
 Bulk Email Success"".  This seperate guide contains a daily 
 routine for you to follow with specific, exact 
 instructions on how to get started.  On day one, for 
 example, I teach you where to find a product to sell. 
 The next day you learn how to build a fresh mailing 
 list.  On the seventh day, you just click send!  Your 
 very first campaign is ready to go.
 
 As a special bonus, you'll recieve a FREE copy 
 of our STEALTH MASS MAILER, a very powerful bulk 
 email program which retails for $49.99! I'll even
 include 7 million email addresses absolutely FREE
 if you order NOW!
 
 Stop wasting your money on auction listing fees, 
 classifieds, and banner ads - they don't work, and 
 never will!  If you are SERIOUS about making money 
 on the Internet, bulk email is your only option.  
 What are you waiting for?  Few of us are willing 
 to share this knowledge, but I promise to teach 
 you everything I know about bulk emailing in this 
 extraordinary bulk emailer's handbook ... The Spambook! 
 
 Once again, here's the deal.  You give me $29.99.  
 I give you ALL THE TOOLS YOU NEED to become a
 successful, high profit email bulk emailer.  INCLUDING:

"Subject: Re: the underground software vulnerability marketplace and its
","Hi Kragen,
 
    This is an interesting analysis.  I think that there are a couple
 of nits I might pick (for example, I don't expect that the market will
 be well developed with highest bidders for while), I think that the
 most important issue, which is that end users won't be able to fix
 their systems, is almost passed over.  I know that you know this, and
 you allude to it, but your essay is getting passed around, so you
 might want to add to it bits about the sysadmin and others.
 
    There's one other point which you don't make, which I think is very
 important, which is that research into defining and addressing classes
 of vulnerabilities can't happen without libraries of available
 vulnerability code.  I can think of three researchers into automated
 methods for addressing vulnerabilities who griped, uninvited, about
 the quality of the existing vulnerability sites.  Doing research into
 a set requires that you have enough examples, in the open, that you
 can define a set, and that the set is added to from time to time so
 you can make and test predictions.
 
    I feel fairly confident in saying that without full disclosure, we
 wouldn't have Stackguard, ITS4, Nissus, or snort.  And the security
 admin's job would be a lot harder.
 
 Adam

 | From: Kragen Sitaker <kragen@pobox.com>
 | To: fork@spamassassin.taint.org
 | Subject: the underground software vulnerability marketplace and its hazards
 | 
 | On August 7th, an entity known as ""iDEFENSE"" sent out an announcement,
 | which is appended to this email.  Briefly, ""iDEFENSE"", which bills
 | itself as ""a global security intelligence company"", is offering cash
 | for information about security vulnerabilities in computer software
 | that are not publicly known, especially if you promise not to tell
 | anyone else.
 | 
 | If this kind of secret traffic is allowed to continue, it will pose a
 | very serious threat to our computer communications infrastructure.
 | 
 | At the moment, the dominant paradigm for computer security research
 | known as ""full disclosure""; people who discover security
 | vulnerabilities in software tell the vendor about them, and a short
 | while later --- after the vendor has had a chance to fix the problem
 | --- they publish the information, including code to exploit the
 | vulnerability, if possible.  
 | 
 | This method has proven far superior to the old paradigm established by
 | CERT in the late 1980s, which its proponents might call ""responsible
 | disclosure"" --- never release working exploit code, and never release
 | any information on the vulnerability before all vendors have released
 | a patch.  This procedure often left hundreds of thousands of computers
 | vulnerable to known bugs for months or years while the vendors worked
 | on features, and often, even after the patches were released, people
 | wouldn't apply them because they didn't know how serious the problem
 | was.
 | 
 | The underground computer criminal community would often discover and
 | exploit these same holes for months or years while the ""responsible
 | disclosure"" process kept their victims, who had no connections in the
 | underground, vulnerable.
 | 
 | The problem with this is that vulnerabilities that are widely known
 | are much less dangerous, because their victims can take steps to
 | reduce their potential impact --- including disabling software,
 | turning off vulnerable features, filtering traffic in transit, and
 | detecting and responding to intrusions.  They are therefore much less
 | useful to would-be intruders.  Also, software companies usually see
 | security vulnerabilities in their software as PR problems, and so
 | prefer to delay publication (and the expense of fixing the bugs) as
 | long as possible.
 | 
 | iDEFENSE is offering a new alternative that appears far more dangerous
 | than either of the two previous paradigms.  They want to be a buyer in
 | a marketplace for secret software vulnerability information, rewarding
 | discoverers of vulnerabilities with cash.  
 | 
 | Not long before, Snosoft, a group of security researchers evidently
 | including some criminal elements, apparently made an offer to sell the
 | secrecy of some software vulnerability information to the software
 | vendor; specifically, they apparently made a private offer to
 | Hewlett-Packard to keep a vulnerability in HP's Tru64 Unix secret if
 | HP retained Snosoft's ""consulting services"".  HP considered this
 | extortion and responded with legal threats, and Snosoft published the
 | information.
 | 
 | If this is allowed to happen, it will cause two problems which,
 | together, add up to a catastrophe.
 | 
 | First, secret software vulnerability information will be available to
 | the highest bidder, and to nobody else.  For reasons explained later,
 | I think the highest bidders will generally be organized crime
 | syndicates, although that will not be obvious to the sellers.
 | 
 | Second, finding software vulnerabilities and keeping them secret will
 | become lucrative for many more talented people.  The result will be
 | --- just as in the ""responsible disclosure"" days --- that the good
 | guys will remain vulnerable for months and years, while the majority
 | of current vulnerabilities are kept secret.
 | 
 | I've heard it argued that the highest bidders will generally be the
 | vendors of the vulnerable software, but I don't think that's
 | plausible.  If someone can steal $20 000 because a software bug lets
 | them, the software vendor is never held liable; often, in fact, the
 | people who administer the software aren't liable, either --- when
 | credit card data are stolen from an e-commerce site, for example.
 | Knowing about a vulnerability before anyone else might save a web-site
 | administrator some time, and it might save the software vendor some
 | negative PR, but it can net the thief thousands of dollars.
 | 
 | I think the highest bidders will be those for whom early vulnerability
 | information is most lucrative --- the thieves who can use it to
 | execute the largest heists without getting caught.  Inevitably, that
 | means organized crime syndicates, although the particular gangs who
 | are good at networked theft may not yet exist.
 | 
 | There might be the occasional case where a market leader, such as
 | Microsoft, could make more money by giving their competitors bad PR
 | than a gang could make by theft.  Think of a remote-root hole in
 | Samba, for example.
 | 
 | Right now, people who know how to find security exploits are either
 | motivated by personal interest in the subject, motivated by the public
 | interest, motivated by a desire for individual recognition, or
 | personally know criminals that benefit from their exploits.  Creating
 | a marketplace in secret vulnerability information would vastly
 | increase the availability of that information to the people who can
 | afford to pay the most for it: spies, terrorists, and organized crime.
 | 
 | Let's not let that happen.

 | Subject: Introducing iDEFENSE's Vulnerability Contributor Program
 | 
 | 
 | Greetings,
 | 
 | iDEFENSE is pleased to announce the official launch of its Vulnerability
 | Contributor Program (VCP). The VCP pays contributors for the advance
 | notification of vulnerabilities, exploit code and malicious code.
 | 
 | iDEFENSE hopes you might consider contributing to the VCP. The following
 | provides answers to some basic questions about the program:
 | 
 | Q. How will it work?
 | A. iDEFENSE understands the majority of security researchers do not publish
 | security research for compensation; rather, it could be for any of a number
 | of motivations, including the following:
 | 
 |          * Pure love of security research
 |          * The desire to protect against harm to targeted networks
 |          * The desire to urge vendors to fix their products
 |          * The publicity that often accompanies disclosure
 | 
 | The VCP is for those who want to have their research made public to the
 | Internet community, but who would also like to be paid for doing the
 | work.The compensation will depend, among other things, on the following
 | items:
 | 
 |          * The kind of information being shared (i.e. vulnerability or exploit)
 |          * The amount of detail and analysis provided
 |          * The potential severity level for the information shared
 |          * The types of applications, operating systems, and other
 |            software and hardware potentially affected
 |          * Verification by iDEFENSE Labs
 |          * The level of exclusivity, if any, for data granted to iDEFENSE
 | 
 | Q. Who should contribute to the VCP?
 | A. The VCP is open to any individual, security research group or other
 | entity.
 | 
 | Q. Why are you launching this program?
 | A. Timeliness remains a key aspect in security intelligence. Contributions
 | to some lists take time before publication to the public at large. More
 | often, many of these services charge clients for access without paying the
 | original contributor. Under the iDEFENSE program, the contributor is
 | compensated, iDEFENSE Labs verifies the issue, and iDEFENSE clients and the
 | public at large are warned in a timely manner.
 | 
 | Q. Who gets the credit?
 | A. The contributor is always credited for discovering the vulnerability or
 | exploit information.
 | 
 | Q. When can I contribute?
 | The VCP is active. You are welcome to begin contributing today.
 | 
 | To learn more, go to http://www.idefense.com/contributor.html. If you have
 | questions or would like to sign up as a contributor to the VCP, please
 | contact us at contributor@idefense.com.

 * Minimum Premium to Endow is a hypothetical, non-guaranteed premium
 that, based on current charges and the current interest rate, would keep
 the policy in force to age 100. Interest rates and charges will change
 over time, as will the Minimum Premium to Endow. These premiums are
 shown as hypothetical figures based on the stated assumptions and are
 shown for comparative purposes only. The actual premium needed to keep
 the policy in force is based on actual results and may be higher or
 lower. ** All guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of the
 issuer.

","fwd-----
 It would appear that Yahoo! has joined the ranks of western companies
 dedicated to helping restrict the freedoms of people in other countries
 for the sake of improving their profit margins. Yahoo! has signed the
 ""Public Pledge on Self-discipline for China Internet Industry"" (more
 here http://www.dfn.org/voices/china/selfdiscipline.htm ), essentially a
 promise to help police Chinese internet users for the
 State:
 
 >>>From this article in The Nando Times:
 http://www.nandotimes.com/technology/story/494845p-3946998c.html
 
 The Chinese version of the popular Yahoo! Internet portal risks becoming
 an online policeman for China's communist government if it keeps a promise
 to voluntarily investigate potentially subversive content, a human rights
 group has warned.
 
 ""If it implements the pledge, Yahoo! will become an agent of Chinese law
 enforcement,"" Kenneth Roth, Human Rights Watch's executive director, said
 Friday. ""It will switch from being an information gateway to an
 information gatekeeper.""

 remove the log statements once running.
 
 I use both.  SpamAssassin (SA) catches things that Razor does not.  There
 were enough false positives with Razor that I do not trust it alone.
 After whitelisting all the newsletters I receive, SA w/ Razor2 does a
 very good job.

 Yeah, the answer isn't here in this list, it's on the spamassassin-users
 list.  I just asked it late last week.
 
 Hint:  Add -H to the spamd startup flags using the latest version of
 spamassassin.

 Have you thought about mirroring the system drives? Might save you serious
 hassle down the line. 
 
 Only kidding but thats what I would do.
 
 CW
 
 ----------------
 OK, Here's how to do it [1] ...
 
 While the disk is still installed in the i686 machine (if that's broken,
 beg, borrow or steal...), remove the i686 versions of glibc and kernel and
 install the i386 versions.  This will break one or two other packages since
 they have entries in /etc/ld.so.conf which belongs to glibc.  these packages
 will need to be reinstalled.  So:
 
 1. rpm -e --nodeps glibc
 
 	Your /etc/ld.so.conf has been saved as /etc/ld.so.conf.rpmsave
 
 2. rpm -ivh glibc-<v.e.r-no>-i386.rpm
 3. rpm -e --nodeps kernel
 4. rpm -ivh kernel-<v.e.r-no>-i386.rpm
 
 This installs the i386 versions of kernel and glibc.  You'll be able to boot
 in a non 686 machine now.  However, X is now broken as is kerberos.  At
 least those are the two I noticed.  Your /etc/ld.so.conf.rpmsave will
 contain clues as to what else might be broken.  To fix X and kerberos you
 need to reinstall their libs (copying /etc/ld.so.conf.rpmsave back to
 /etc/ld.so.conf doesn't seem to work):
 
 1. rpm -ivh --replacepkgs XFree86-libs-<v.e.r-no>-i386.rpm
 2. rpm -ivh --replacepkgs krb5-libs-<v.e.r-no>-i386.rpm
 
 fixes them.  Other libs listed in _my_ /etc/ld.so.conf are qt, mysql and
 sane.  If they start behaving in odd fashions, it may be related.
 Reinstalling the libs for these packages may fix that.
 
 Thanks guys...

 Since this thing will be on a sub 56k dialup, any remote admin will be
 strictly of the emergency variety.  I plan to have the server mail me its
 logs and stuff regurlarly so I can keep an eye on it but most/all of the
 admin will be done locally.

 [1] ""it"" being migrate a Hard Disk from an Intel P3/4/celeron box to an AMD
 K6-x box.  Essentially, the P3/4/celeron processor is an i686 class while
 the AMD K6 processor is an i586 class (not sure about the AMD athlon or
 duron chips).  A RHL installed on the i686 class machine will not boot on an
 i586 calss box since both kernel and glibc are optimised for i686.  The
 solution is to replace the i686 kernel and glibc with i386 versions.

 I think I could handle commenting out the lowest SPAM_PHRASE_XX_YY
 scores.  If the GA could handle this sort of thing so they'd
 automatically be zeroed, I'd feel better since the ranges could change
 next time the phrase list is regenerated or the algorithm tweaked.
 
 I think we need to understand why DATE_IN_PAST_48_96 is so low before
 we remove it.  The two rules on either side perform quite well.

 Okay, drop SUBJ_MISSING.

 Probably a few, those seemed like the best prospects to me.

 I only want a bugzilla ticket for each one if people are okay with
 quick WONTFIX closes on the ones deemed unworthy of recovery.
 
 If you could put the stats for each rule in the ticket somehow (should
 be automatable with email at the very least), it would help.

","i agree with rob. i think if the phones (and mms is building traction in europe in handsets), this might be interesting. bottom line is will it a) help sell phones and b) bill enough time on the wcarriers networks?
 
 anyone remember the polariod photo sticker fad? low quality, small in size. but kids totally dug that stuff. seems like every adolescent girl had that stuff at one point. and it never replaced or aimed to replace digital cameras or normal photographs. i don't think mms photos will be a substitute for other photography - developed at the local 1 hour joint or digital photos on your pc. i think it expands the market and forms a new category. the extent of the category size is the big question (will it be a fad or will it a sustained market). that's consumer behavior and marketing. but i don't think the technology adoption will follow a substitution of another product on the market (in this case, digital photos or normal photos). europe's the one to watch - more teenagers have wireless phones and if the pricing and marketing is right, they'll figure out what to do with it once the carriers how to figure out how to market it to them.

 Oh thats right Greg.  Because was explicitly clear that the pro-Bush
 folks went out and did the permit dance.   So where in the article is
 this again?
 
 Lets get something straight here.   This -is- a First Amendment issue.
 Public streets, provided one isn't blocking traffic, generally tend to
 be sorta ok, at least from my last interpretation of Con Law a few
 years ago (I'll feign ignorance wrt the fact that laws may have
 changed, and the specific facts in this case are weak).    IF this guy
 _was_ merely holding a sign (which it seems was the case for all the
 pro-bush folks) he did nothing wrong.  He certainly didn't do enough
 of a wrong to warrant a disorderly conduct charge.
 
 I'll play with your perspective though.   Lets assume a few things.
 If I walk into the city office and tell them I want to peacably
 assemble against Bush, do you think they'll give me a permit?
 Probably not.   So I lie.   Then the cop does what happened in this
 scenario.  HE walks up, checks my permit and finds out that I
 falsified my statement to get this said document.   He arrests me.
 End of story.

 I'll agree with Owen on this one.  Muddied my ass.  How hard is it to
 chose between a Republocrat or a Demipublican?   Not very.  Shouting
 down has grown to become the answer because the government, over a
 span of years, and with the help of the Courts -has- limited the
 rights we have as citizens under the First Amendment.    If you
 question the policy about terrorism, or drugs, or Iraq, or Bush in
 general, you're aiding terrorism.   If you challenge the beliefs of
 the folks attending the various shadowy G8 conferences, you're an
 anarchist, and you're herded off to a 'designated protest spot' miles
 away from anything.   Part of the point of speech is to be -heard-.
 I can scream on my soapbox in the forest somewhere, and while thats
 speech, its not effective speech.  People are screaming and shouting
 over the political figures because they cannot be  heard in any other
 way.

 Getting back to my original point.  How do you communicate  an idea to
 an unknown audience, if you're miles from where the audience is?   How
 do you bypass the rules for being -miles- away from the audience
 without violating the rules of the regime?  I don't think Mr. Nell was
 throwing pies at Bush.  A sign, the last time I checked, didn't cause
 physical injury, or even emotional harm.  If I remember Cohen v.
 California, 403 U.S. 15 (1971), its not the individual speaking that
 has the requirement to desist, but the individual listening who has
 the option to leave.
 
 
 Just my .02, while its still considered legal.

     S> friction generated by splitting society too much along
     S> religious lines.  One Post article pointed out that the problem
     S> basically stemmed from the vertical integration of areas along
     S> religious lines all the way to schools, government, political
     S> party, etc.  (Of course both cases have a heritage of British
     S> conquest, but who doesn't?)
 
 When we launched the Native Net in 1989, one of the first things we
 noticed on networking aboriginal groups around the world is that the
 British Army, with the US Army as a proxy by extension, were the
 common thread.  Where neither was present (physically or through
 influence) there /tended/ to be less violence.
 
 The issue in Ireland is complex, but rest assured that religious
 aspects are only a co-incidence of the invader/colonials being
 predominantly members of the Royal-headed Anglicans and the aboriginal
 population being predominantly members of the Pope-headed Catholics.
 The conflict itself has nothing to do with ideology or practice, since
 the Anglican Church is a near-identical clone of Catholicism.
 
 (now I bet that's going to attract some healthy debate ;)
 
     S> .. most Protestants are unionists who want the
     S> province to remain part of Britain.
 
 Mebst. Mebst.  It's the other way around.  Most Unionists are protestants.
 It's their _Unionism_ that is the source of the conflict, not their
 sacriments.
 
     S> ... Police records and historians agree that the most lethal
     S> group by far was the IRA, fighting on the Catholic side with a
     S> goal of a united Ireland
 
 And which side of the colonial fence do you suppose the Police and
 Historians sit?  If the Russians had invaded the USA as feared in
 episodes such as the Bay of Pigs, would the Americans have organized
 to become a ""lethal force"", or would they have just said, ""Oh well,
 there goes /that/ democracy!"" and settle in under communist rule?
 
 Just wondering.
 
     >> 2. The US is trying to avoid making war on the Muslim religion.
 
 It is interesting to me that the Canadian media is trying to paint
 Chretien as some sort of buffoon for saying that 3rd-world poverty was
 a major contributor to 9-11.  If they'd /watch/ his now-infamous
 interview, they'd see that it's still us-against-hooligans, but his
 point is that the hooligans would not be able to find friendly states
 so easily if those states were not so bled-dry by the west.
 
 The same is true of street-gangs: When people are disenfranchised,
 it's easier to offer them the Triad as a new family.  You get
 cellphones, cars, a dry place to live.  Triad, biker gangs, mafia, the
 IRA, Al Queda ... we've been fighting the War on Terrorism for as long
 as there's been commerce, so you'd think we'd /realize/ that
 escalation of violence is not a solution.

"Subject: SV: More content filtering woes
","Hi Thor,
 
 [Still trying to catch my breath] :-)
 
 I guess there's no easy way to avoid this. In order to proactively
 protect endusers they'll need to put such code (or part of it) into
 their defs. Since antivirus products still gets smarter and smarter and
 heuristics are getting better and better the odds aginst not running
 into false positives are poor. Some products will woe plenty of these
 some are better to avoid the madness (!). I'll leave you to do the test.
 Consider that corporate and endusers are most likely using Microsoft
 software without updating as they should. AV-software is now trying to
 protect these poor souls adding proxy functionality to catch e.g.
 malicious content in HTML based e-mails and for a good reason. Looking
 at http://www.pivx.com/larholm/unpatched/ says it all!  ;-)

     Some 20,000 domestic-help robots were sold worldwide last year, half

 * EFF Submits Letter to FCC Chairman Regarding BPDG Proposal
 
 The Honorable Michael K. Powell Chairman Federal Communications
 Commission 445 12th Street, S.W. Suite 8C453 Washington, DC 20554
 
 
 BY FACSIMILE, ELECTRONIC MAIL, AND POSTAL MAIL
 
 Dear Chairman Powell:
 
 I am writing to you today in regards to the digital television
 Broadcast Flag; specifically, I write in response to Sen. Hollings'
 and Representatives Dingell and Tauzin's letters of July 19, which
 urged you to mandate the Broadcast Flag proposal outlined in the
 final report of the Broadcast Protection Discussion Group.
 
 The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is a donor-supported
 non-profit organization that works to uphold civil liberties
 interests in technology policy and law. EFF has played a critical
 role in safeguarding crucial freedoms related to computers, the
 Internet and consumer electronics devices, defeating the restriction
 on strong cryptography exports; securing the legal principle that
 Internet wiretaps must only proceed in conjunction with a warrant;
 and defending academics, researchers and commercial interests
 against DMCA-related prosecution.
 
 EFF was an active participant in the Broadcast Protection Discussion
 Group. We attended the group's meetings and conference calls and
 participated in the group's policy and technical mailing-lists. EFF
 also maintains a web-site that was and is the only public source of
 information on the Broadcast Flag negotiations and proposal. The
 site can be found at http://bpdg.blogs.eff.org. EFF devoted
 thousands of staff-hours to publicizing the existence and nature of
 the BPDG to the public, to civil liberties and consumer-advocacy
 groups, and to entrepreneurial companies and software authors whose
 products were threatened by the proceedings.
 
 When you and I met at Esther Dyson's PC Forum last March, we spoke
 briefly about the civil liberties interests that would be undermined
 by the Broadcast Protection Discussion Group's mandate. The BPDG
 proposal will have grave consequences for innovation, free
 expression, competition and consumer interests. Worst of all, it
 will add unnecessary complexity and expense to the DTV transition,
 compromising DTV adoption itself.
 
 As you are aware, technologists have traditionally manufactured
 those devices they believed would be successful in the market, often
 in spite of the misgivings of rights-holders. From the piano roll to
 the PVR, technologists have enjoyed the freedom to ship whatever
 products they believe the public will pay for; what's more,
 innovation has always thrived best where there were the fewest
 regulatory hurdles. NTSC tuners and devices are governed by precious
 few regulations, and consequently we see a rich field of products
 that interact with them, from the VCR Plus to tuner-cards for PCs to
 the PVR. The Broadcast Flag proposal would limit technologists to
 shipping those products that met with the approval of MPAA member
 companies. No entrepreneur or software author will know, a priori,
 whether his innovative DTV product will be legal in the market until
 he has gone to the expense of building it and taking it around to
 the Hollywood studios for review.
 
 Consumers and industry alike have benefitted greatly from the ""Open
 Source"" or ""Free Software"" movement, in which technologies are
 distributed in a form that encourages end-user modification. From
 server-software like the web-wide success-story apache, to operating
 systems like GNU/Linux, to consumer applications like the Mozilla
 browser, Free Software is a powerful force for innovation, consumer
 benefit and commercial activity. The BPDG proposal implicitly bans
 Free Software DTV applications -- such as the DScaler de-interlacer
 and the GNU Radio software-defined radio program -- as these
 applications are built to be modified by end-users, something that
 is banned under the BPDG proposal. The tamper-resistance component
 of the BPDG's ""Robustness Requirements"" will create and entire class
 of illegal software applications, abridging the traditional First
 Amendment freedom enjoyed by software authors who create expressive
 speech in code form under one of several Free Software/Open Source
 licenses.
 
 The BPDG nominally set out to create an objective standard, a bright
 line that technologists could hew to in order to avoid liability
 when deploying their products. However, the end product of the BPDG
 was a ""standard"" that contained no objective criteria for legal
 technology; rather, the standard required that new technologies be
 approved by MPAA member companies. Not uncoincidentally, the only
 technologies that were approved by the MPAA -- and hence the only
 legal technologies -- were those produced by the 4C and 5C
 consortia, a group of technology companies that acted as the MPAA's
 allies throughout the BPDG process. This is an harbinger of the sort
 of regime that the BPDG standard will usher in: technology companies
 will be able to shut their competitors out of the marketplace by
 allying themselves with Hollywood, brokering deals to allow certain
 technologies and outlaw others.
 
 The marketplace is a proven mechanism for rapidly and efficiently
 producing products that increase the value and desirability of new
 technologies, such as DTV. A BPDG mandate would subvert the market
 for DTV innovation. Competing companies with lower-cost DTV
 technology alternatives would be restrained from bringing these to
 market if they failed to assuage the MPAA's concerns about
 unauthorized redistribution. Furthermore, the universe of
 unauthorized-but-lawful uses for DTV programming will be shrunk down
 to the much smaller space of explicitly authorized uses. The ability
 of the public to make unauthorized-but-lawful uses of television
 programming has been an historical force for increasing the value of
 broadcast programming, from the VCR to the PVR.
 
 Ironically, the inevitable damage that a Broadcast Flag mandate
 would do to innovation, competition and consumer interests can only
 slow down DTV adoption, by driving up the cost of DTV devices while
 reducing the number of desirable features that an open market would
 create. If the public is offered less functionality for more money,
 they will not flock to DTV.
 
 The most disheartening thing about the Broadcast Flag is that there
 is neither a strong case that the Broadcast Flag is a necessary tool
 for protecting copyright, nor that the Broadcast Flag would be
 effective in that role. The existing practice of Internet
 infringement of broadcast programming -- analog captures from
 devices that satisfy the requirements of the BPDG proposal -- would
 not be stopped by the presence of a Broadcast Flag.
 Higher-resolution DTV signals will likewise present no challenge to
 determined infringers, who can capture full-quality analog signal
 from DTV devices and then re-digitize them, suffering only a single
 generation's worth of loss-of-quality before the programming enters
 the Internet.
 
 Meanwhile, the underlying rubric for a Broadcast Flag -- that
 infringement will undermine Hollywood's business to the point that
 movies will no longer be available to the public, reducing the value
 of DTV -- is no more than superstition. No credible study or
 analysis, undertaken by a neutral party, has ever been presented to
 Congress, the FCC, the CPTWG or the BPDG supporting this notion. The
 public is being asked to sacrifice its rights in copyright; industry
 is being asked to place its right to innovation in the hands of
 entertainers; the US government is being asked to mandate
 extraordinary, unprecedented regulation of the $600 billion
 technology sector -- all on the uncorroborated opinions of a few
 studio executives.
 
 EFF welcomes the FCC's oversight of the Broadcast Flag issue. The
 BPDG proceedings took place behind a shroud of secrecy, in a
 looking-glass ""public process"" where only those participants the
 organizers wanted to hear from were made privy to its existence,
 where the co-chairs invented rules and processes on the fly to suit
 the needs of the entertainment interests and the technology
 companies that had privately secured a promise of a legal monopoly
 for their products, where the press was banned.
 
 The FCC has an admirable tradition of seeking and weighing public
 opinion in its proceedings. As the FCC considers the Broadcast Flag,
 EFF hopes that it will start anew, setting aside the findings of the
 BPDG in light of the concerns raised by Microsoft, Philips, Sharp,
 Thomson, and Zenith, as well as non-profit organizations including
 EFF, Consumers Union, Consumer Federation of America, the Free
 Software Foundation, Public Knowledge, digitalconsumer.org, the
 Center for Democracy in Technology, and the Computer and
 Communications Industry Association.
 
 Thank you for attention in this matter. Please let me know if we can
 be of any further assistance to you.
 
 Sincerely yours,
 
 Cory Doctorow for the Electronic Frontier Foundation

 * Update on Intel Corp. v. Hamidi
 
 Intel Corp. v. Hamidi is now on appeal to the California Supreme
 Court. EFF filed an amicus brief in support of Ken Hamidi on Aug. 6,
 2002. The facts are simple: Over about two years, Hamidi on six
 occasions sent e-mail critical of Intel's employment practices to
 between 8,000 and 35,000 Intel employees. Intel demanded that Hamidi
 stop, but he refused. Intel obtained an injunction barring Hamidi
 from e-mailing Intel employees at their Intel e-mail addresses,
 based on the common-law tort of ""trespass to chattels."" (""Chattel""
 is a legal term that refers to personal property, as opposed to
 property in land.)
 
 EFF's amicus brief argues three main points.
 
 (1) Intel did not qualify for relief under ""trespass to chattels""
 because Intel's e-mail servers were not themselves harmed by
 Hamidi's e-mails. If Intel was harmed, it was because the content of
 Hamidi's e-mails affected Intel employees, not because sending the
 e-mails affected the functioning of Intel's servers.
 
 (2) By focusing on unwanted ""contact"" with the chattel and ignoring
 the harm requirement, the court of appeal turned ""trespass to
 chattels"" into a doctrine that threatens common Internet activity
 like search engines and linking. For example, if a website posted a
 ""no trespassing"" sign, any ""contact"" by a search engine could be
 considered a trespass even if it caused no harm.
 
 (3) The court of appeal wrongly held that the injunction did not
 infringe Hamidi's freedom of speech. The First Amendment limits
 private parties' legal remedies in many areas of law, such as libel,
 out of concern that private parties will use the law to suppress
 criticism. The same principle should apply here, where Intel's
 claims of harm stem from the meaning of Hamidi's speech.

 * DeCSS Author Johansen's Trial Rescheduled
 
 The trial of Norwegian teen Jon Johansen, who created the
 controversial DeCSS software, has been pushed back again. It is now
 scheduled to be heard on December 9, 2002, in Oslo, Norway. In the
 fall of 1999, Johansen and his team reverse-engineered the content
 scrambling system (CSS) software used to encrypt DVDs in an effort
 to build a DVD player for the Linux operating system. In January of
 2002, the Norwegian Economic Crime Unit (OKOKRIM) charged Johansen
 with a violation of Norwegian Criminal Code Section 145.2, which
 outlaws breaking into a third-party's property in order to steal
 data that one is not entitled to. This prosecution marks the first
 time the law will be used to prosecute a person for accessing his
 own property (his own DVD). Johansen faces two years in prison if
 convicted. The prosecution is based on a formal complaint filed by
 the Motion Picture Association.
 
 The trial had originally been scheduled to take place in June of 
 2002 but was rescheduled when the court could not find any qualified 
 judges to hear Johansen's case.  Now the case is scheduled to be 
 heard by a three-judge panel. Help Jon in his battle against

 * Bunnie Presents Paper on XBox Reverse Engineering
 
 Paper Explains Flaw in Videogame Security System
 
 Researcher Escapes Chilling Effect of Digital Copyright Law
 
 Electronic Frontier Foundation Media Advisory
 
 For Immediate Release: Thursday, August 9, 2002
 
 San Francisco - The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is pleased
 to announce that former MIT doctoral student Andrew ""Bunnie"" Huang
 will present a paper explaining a security flaw in the Microsoft
 Xbox (TM) videogame system.
 
 Huang will present his paper, ""Keeping Secrets in Hardware: the
 Microsoft X-BOX Case Study,"" at 5:25 p.m. PDT on August 13, 2002, at
 the 2002 Workshop on Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems
 (CHES 2002) in Redwood City, California (Aug. 13-15, 2002).
 
 The Xbox security system is intended to allow people to play only
 videogames authorized by Microsoft. Huang's paper ""shows how a
 person could defeat that system with a small hardware investment,""
 said MIT Professor Hal Abelson, one of Huang's advisors. ""More
 importantly, the paper relates the security vulnerability to a
 general design flaw shared by other high-profile security systems
 such as the government's Clipper Chip and the movie industry's
 Contents Scrambling System (CSS) for DVD players.""
 
 Huang contacted EFF in March after his advisors told him that his
 preliminary findings raised potentially significant legal questions.
 With the help of Boston College law professor Joe Liu, EFF worked
 with Huang, Abelson, and MIT administrators to analyze the legal
 issues and draft letters notifying Microsoft of Huang's research
 findings and intended publication, one of the steps encouraged by
 Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).
 
 Microsoft told Huang and Abelson that while it might prefer that the
 paper not be published, it would be inappropriate to ask MIT to
 withhold the paper.
 
 ""Microsoft deserves praise for making no attempt to control
 publication,"" said Abelson. ""Their response shows that they value
 academic freedom, and that they appreciate the critical role of
 unfettered research and publication in advancing technology.""
 
 Other companies have reacted otherwise, using the DMCA to threaten
 researchers. The Recording Industry Association of America last year
 warned Princeton Professor Edward Felten after his research team
 exposed weaknesses in digital music security technologies. Last
 month, Hewlett Packard (HP) threatened research collective SnoSoft
 over exposing a security vulnerability in HP's Tru64 Unix operating
 system. Soon after, HP clarified that it would not use the DMCA to
 stifle research or impede the flow of information that would improve
 computer security.
 
 Huang said that while he is glad he can openly present his paper,
 ""The DMCA clearly had a chilling effect on my work. I was afraid to
 submit my research for peer review until after the EFF's efforts to
 clear potential legal restraints.""
 
 ""Researchers should be analyzing security, not worrying about
 getting sued,"" said EFF Senior Staff Attorney Lee Tien.

 * Baen Books expands fair-use-friendly e-book program
 
 Baen Books will bind a CD-ROM into the October 2002 hardcover
 edition of *War of Honor,* the latest volume in David Weber's epic
 Honor Harrington space-opera. The CD will contain at least 22
 complete novels, all in open formats like html and RTF, with the
 fair-use-friendly admonishment ""This disk and its contents may be
 copied and shared but NOT sold."" Included on the disk are the entire
 Honor Harrington series to date, as well as other titles from the
 Baen line, including Keith Laumer's *Retief!* and Larry Niven and
 Jerry Pournelle's *Fallen Angels*.
 
 Baen has been a banner-carrier for fair-use in electronic
 publishing, shipping text and html files that can be played on a
 multitude of devices. Other publishers have chosen to publish their
 material in copy-controlled formats that make it impossible to
 legally loan or resell the titles you purchase, are locked to a
 specific device, can't play on every operating system, and
 occasionally lock out assistive technology like the screen-readers
 employed by the blind.
 
 Dmitry Skylarov, a Russian scientist, was arrested in July 2001, for
 demonstrating how end-users could defeat the copy-prevention
 employed by Adobe's e-book technology. Adobe asked the FBI to arrest
 Skylarov for violating the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA),
 which makes it a crime to describe techniques for circumventing
 copy-prevention technology. Though Skylarov was later released, his
 employer, ElcomSoft, is still facing charges in the USA, and the
 Russian government has issued an advisory warning Russian scientists
 to steer clear of American technical conferences until the DMCA is
 repealed.
 
 Here is Baen's statement on the CD release:
 
 You are about to start playing with a CD-ROM that has fairly
 extraordinary content. As of this writing it includes twenty-two
 UNENCRYPTED novels in several formats, the ten Honor Harrington
 Novels, 3 Honor Harrington Anthologies and 9 novels by friends of
 Honor, and by the time of distribution it may well contain more.
 (More than twenty novels for free, and with no stupid codes to work
 around. Think of that.) The reason for the plethora of formats is to
 try to please the people who want to read the novels on their Palm
 Pilots or other text-specialized palm-sized devices.

 the dated address that my from appears as is a good address for five days
 for anyone.  after that it requires a confirm message from the sender.
 my regular email address requires a confirm address if i haven't
 explicitly given permission to the sender.
 
 and yes, spammers could try to set up a system to reply to my confirm
 messages, but that would require them to a) give out a valid email address
 in their From headers, and b) use a lot more bandwidth then they do now
 (thereby costing them more money).
 
 oh, and they can't forge confirm messages.  the confirm message system
 works something like this:
 
     message goes in the pending q and is assigned an id.
     that id is encrypted and used to create the from address of the
 	outgoing confirm mail - kevin+confirm+kghdsfg@ie.suberic.net
     only a message to that address will work to free the message from
 	the q (or i can free it using tmda-pending).
 
 all of this is discussed on http://tmda.sf.net/

 You could go the same way as the others and call it gkrellm2 and

 I've never installed source rpms with apt, but I suppose that if you get
 file not found, it's because the source rpm was installed. To see if this
 is the case, go to /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/ and if you see mplayer.spec,
 you'll just need to do ""rpm -bb mplayer.spec"" to get a binary build in

"Subject: Unseen window versus Sequences Window
","I apologize for not catching up to the current code in so long.
 
 Now that I have I'm trying to resolve ""breakage"" and differences.
 
 The unseen window seems to have been replaced with the sequences 
 window.  While I appreciate the flexibility of the sequences 
 window, the unseen window filled an important-to-me need:  It 
 was tiny and could be set to show on all desktops of a virtual 
 window manager without taking a lot of space.  Since my normal 
 mode of operation involves two copies of exmh displaying on a 
 1024x768 vnc session, screen space is at a premium.
 
 As things stand now, I have a sequences window that shows a lot
 more information than I need to have handy and takes up a lot 
 more room than I can ""spare"".
 
 I can see that I could like the new sequences window a lot for 
 certain operations.  But I'd like a nice uncluttered, tiny 
 window that _only_ shows me info on my unread mail.
 
 One possibility that occurs to me would be a button or mouse
 click that ""shrinks"" the Sequences window to show only the
 sequences in the ""always show"" list.  And of course a way to 
 expand it back.

 <mild rant>
 This is something that often annoys me. Programmers can spend hours inlining
 code and relying on optimisation tools to improve performance. The best
 performance improvement can be obtained by fixing the algorithm.
 
 Most function calls get made very rarely. Optimising them often makes no
 sense, produces illegable code and nonsense algorithms.
 
 Inlining will help in functions that get called frequently and are small -
 such as string manipulation routines. But these are a small part of most
 applications.
 
 One example I frequently see is people optimising a database function call.
 Most database accesses involve many abstraction layers and millions of
 instruction cycles. Trying to save a few instruction cycles would be a cost
 saving of, say, 5 seconds in 20 hours.
 
 But a simple hashmap cache of common data without any compiler or inline
 optimisations can turn that same 20 hours into 10 minutes.
 
 </mild rant>

"Subject: Cost-Effective MLM/Bizop Phone-Screened Leads
","<html>
 Hello, <br><br>
 <div align=""center""><font size=5><u>Premium Phone Qualified <br>
 Business Opportunity Leads<br><br>
 </u></font><font size=4>If you're spending money marketing a Business <b>Opportunity </b>or <b>MLM</b>,<br>
 you will <b><i><u>definitely</u> </i></b>be interested in <br>
 what we have to offer you. <br><br>
 <br>
 </font></div>
 You're <i><u>tired</u> </i>of blindly spending money for leads and not having <br>
 any idea what kind of response you'll get from it.&nbsp; Sometimes<br>
 calling 100 people <b>without one single signup!</b>&nbsp; Sometimes <br>
 talking to people who have been <b>bombarded</b> by bizop pitches<br>
 to the point of them <u>hanging up</u> when you call!&nbsp; (Leads oversold)<br><br>
 We're here to help! <br><br>
 We'll get you <i><u>qualified leads for your MLM or Business Opportunity.</u></i> <br><br>
 <b>Period.</b> <br><br>
 No qualifiers, no conditions, no nonsense. <br><br>
 We'll do it <i><u>quickly,</u></i> and <i><u>professionally</u></i>. <br><br>
 <i>And we won't ask you for a <u>single dime</u> without <b>guaranteeing</b> <u>results</u>!<br><br>
 <br>
 </i><b><u>Here's How We Generate Our Leads...<br><br>
 </u></b>-<b> All of these Leads are generated IN-HOUSE!<br><br>
 </b>- One source we use for Lead-generation is a <b>Business Opportunity<br>
 Seeker Lead List</b> of people who have requested info. about making <br>
 extra income from home by either filling out an online questionnaire,<br>
 or responding to an email ad, classified ad, postcard, etc.,.<br><br>
 - The other source we use is an Automated Call Center.<br>
 We have computerized software that dials up LOCAL residents,<br>
 plays a recorded message asking them if they're interested in<br>
 making money from home.&nbsp; If they are, the system records their<br>
 name and phone number for us to CALL BACK AND QUALIFY.<br><br>
 - The prospects that come from either of the above sources are then<br>
 <b>PHONE INTERVIEWED BY US, here in our offices </b>and the following <br>
 info. is asked (after confirming their desire to find an opportunity):<br><br>
 <b>Name:<br>
 Email:<br>
 Phone:<br>
 Best time to call:<br>
 State:<br>
 Reason they want to work from home!:<br>
 How much they want to make per month:<br>
 How much time they can commit per week:<br>
 How much money they have available for startup:<br>
 If they see an opportunity, how soon they would get started:<br><br>
 We'll close by telling them they'll be contacted by no<br>
 more than 3 or 4 people regarding different opportunities.<br><br>
 </b>- Then the Leads are submitted to a website we set up for you, <br>
 from which the results are then forwarded to you by email.<br><br>
 - This way, <b>you get the Leads fresh, and in *real-time*</b> <br>
 (only minutes old).&nbsp; Never more than 24 hours old.&nbsp; Guaranteed!<br><br>
 - We <b>GUARANTEE</b> that you'll receive <u>AT LEAST</u> a valid <u>Name</u>, <br>
 <u>Phone Number</u> and the <u>Time-Date Stamp</u> corresponding to when<br>
 the Lead was generated!&nbsp; However, almost ALL leads will have<br>
 ALL of the information asked above.<br><br>
 <br>
 <b>Benefits of our Phone Qualified Lead Generation System:<br><br>
 </b>1. They will be <b>Extremely Qualified</b> due to the nature of the <br>
 qualifying questions that will be asked (above).<br><br>
 2. They are <b>Super-Fresh!</b>&nbsp; Delivered in Real-Time only <b>moments <br>
 </b>after they are contacted and qualified!&nbsp; (Not 30-120 days old)<br><br>
 3. They're <b>Targeted.</b>&nbsp; Each Lead we generate originates from a<br>
 targeted list of business opportunity seekers.<br><br>
 4. They're <b>Highly Receptive!</b>&nbsp; <b>Receptivity is very, very high</b> <br>
 because they <b>aren't bombarded by tons of people pitching <br>
 them on opportunities!</b>&nbsp; Also they'll remember speaking to <br>
 someone over the phone.&nbsp; Especially since <b>we tell them to <br>
 expect your call!<br><br>
 </b>5. <b>No &quot;feast or famine&quot;</b> activity.&nbsp; Leads will be coming in <br>
 regularly.&nbsp; You dictate the flow!<br><br>
 6. <b>No more cold calls!&nbsp; </b>We tell your prospects you'll be calling.<br><br>
 7. You can <b>*personalize* your approach</b> with the info. you <br>
 get with each Lead!<br><br>
 8. <b>Save Time.&nbsp; </b>Naturally, better Leads means less calls to get a sale.<br><br>
 9. <b>Lower &quot;burnout&quot; factor.</b>&nbsp; Calling red-hot Leads makes it easier <br>
 to pick up the phone, day in and day out.<br><br>
 10. You can <b>sort your Leads</b> based on their responses and call the<br>
 hottest ones first.<br><br>
 11. You can <b>get new reps started quicker</b> using these Leads due <br>
 to <b>higher closing ratios</b>.&nbsp; Of course, this builds faster and stronger <br>
 momentum, and skyrockets &quot;new rep retention&quot; as a result of <br>
 &quot;quick successes&quot;.<br><br>
 12. The <b>Leads will be uniform </b>- almost all leads will have the info. <br>
 indicated above. (All leads will have valid phone numbers.)<br><br>
 13. They're <b>double-qualified</b> because to generate the Lead, <br>
 a list of previous business opportunity seekers is used.<br><br>
 14. Excellent <b>control of the flow of Leads</b> coming through.<br><br>
 If you've been trying to run things too long without a <u>steady flow</u> of high<br>
 quality leads, call us <i><u>NOW</u></i> to get things in motion.&nbsp; Just let us know <br>
 what program you want to advertise and we'll create a customized <br>
 lead-generation campaign for you. <br><br>
 Since your need to get business moving has probably never been <br>
 more critical than it is today, why not call us <b><u>NOW!<br><br>
 </u></b>These are <b><i><u>fresh, highly qualified leads</u></i></b> because these people aren't <br>
 just responding to some &quot;Generic Business Opportunity&quot; ad, they're <br>
 contacted <b>over the phone specifically</b> for <b><u>YOUR</u></b> company!&nbsp; And we <br>
 forward you the leads within <b><u>minutes</u></b> of the lead being generated - not <br>
 days, weeks, or months!<br><br>

 I've not used Spamassassin on the KISS principle. I just have procmail
 adding an X-header and optionally modifying the Subject if razor-check

 2. Pick of the Week
 
    DECK
    Version: 3.5
    File size: 6.6MB
    License: Free to try; $399.00 to buy
    Minimum Requirements: Mac OS 9.x or Mac OS X
 
    Looking for a professional, multitrack audio workstation
    under OS X? This entry from BIAS, while maybe not the most
    attractive Mac app on the block, gives you some hefty
    editing functionality--whether you're working in broadcast,
    film, video, or any other multimedia environment. The big
    brother to BIAS' cheaper Deck LE, Deck 3.5 lets you process
    soundtracks, edit dialogue, spot effects, and record
    ADR-style voice-overs. Deck also supports surround mixing and
    up to four real-time effects plug-ins per track for music
    production. A good value, and one of the first of its kind
    to hit OS X, this midrange app deserves a listen. You're on
    Deck:

    IN INTERNET:
 
    CAPTAIN FTP
    Version: 1.3
    File size: 793K
    License: Free
    Minimum requirements: Mac OS X
 
    Designed completely from scratch to work with OS X, Captain
    FTP is a new client that makes finding, uploading, and
    downloading files online easier than ever. Since it makes
    full use of OS X's multithreaded multitasking capabilities,
    you can set up as many simultaneous connections as you like
    without slowing down other work on your Mac too much. The
    program supports drag-and-drop operation and resuming
    interrupted downloads. It also sports a built-in address
    book, and integrated BBEdit links. The interface deserves
    awards for clarity and good looks. Grab files in style:

    AQUILACALENDAR
    Version: 1.19
    File size: 1.63MB
    License: Free to try; $20.00 to buy
    Minimum Requirements: Mac OS X
 
    One of the most frustrating things about off-the-shelf
    organizer applications is that they try to force everyone to
    keep track of things in the same way. AquilaCalendar is
    refreshingly different: you can design your own calendar
    windows, choosing from a plethora of basic options (day,
    week, month, year, several months together, and so on), customize
    your calendar with colors and fonts, and more. To-do lists
    and notes-to-self can be added to calendars or you can add a
    handy clock and holiday markers, among other options. The
    interface fits with the OS X design theme, and makes getting
    organized no more difficult than it has to be. Get organized:

    translucent drag-and-drop capabilities, several text styles,

    Remember the classic arcade game Bomberman? Even if you
    don't, you should take this remake of the old classic for a
    spin. Maneuver your way through a maze of corridors while
    setting off bombs to clear a path for your escape. You'll
    also need to pick up coins for extra points and stay clear
    of those nasty aliens to stay alive. Blast your way through
    eight alien-infested areas, each one divided into 10
    subzones, and kick the Big Alien Boss back to where he came
    from. Blast away:

 Well, you're lucky if it sometimes works for you.  Mine hang all the 
 time, have to kill 'em with -9.  And after that, rpm doesn't work at all 
 (hangs right after i run the command, prints nothing).  Have to reboot 
 the machine to get anything rpm-related to work again.

 The first two are wrong. The first amendment DOES
 protect speech the Supreme Court decides it protects
 (duh!), and that happens to include most of what
 people consider hate speech. Unlike many other
 nations, the US has no laws against hate speech, per
 se. And the first amendment is the reason for that.

 unfortunately, figuring out what type to buy is often both 
 difficult and frustrating.

 <font size=""-1"">Whatever happened to the straightforward, dedicated PIM?
    PIM/contact managers, such as the ubiquitous Outlook and
    Lotus, pushed them to the sidelines. But a few PIMs survived
    this enforced obscurity. If you need a plain PIM that doesn't
    cost a fortune, one of these may tickle your fancy.

    Gnutella open-source guru Gene Kan, who died on June
    29 in an apparent suicide, was clearly beloved by the CNET
    community. Last week, search requests for information on
    25-year-old Kan far outweighed the kind of requests on
    products and companies I usually see. A pioneer in the
    peer-to-peer space, many credit him with legitimizing file
    sharing--making it about more than music, according to Wired
    News.

    The annual Apple lovefest in New York is always a
    good show, whether or not Steve Jobs has anything real to
    announce. So far, it looks like Apple has already surprised a
    few by announcing the release of QuickTime 6.0 (see No. 7),
    which many thought would get bogged down in a licensing
    quagmire.

    It's been a rocky road thus far for the eBay and
    PayPal deal. Soon after eBay announced it was buying PayPal
    for $1.5 billion, shareholders filed a lawsuit claiming that
    PayPal's price tag was too low. This week, PayPal is being
    subpoenaed by the New York attorney general in regard to its
    involvement with online gambling transactions.

    I'm just going to leave this common term for 802.11 up
    on the Buzz Meter permanently. This time, Wi-Fi is getting
    interest because of a possible pact between tech heavyweights,
    including Intel, AT&amp;T Wireless, and Verizon Communications, to
    build wireless access places across the nation in public areas
    where people would want to launch onto the Net, such as
    airports.

    This is the for-education-only computer that consumers
    wanted so badly that Apple released it to them. The CNET
    review is out, and here's the word: the eMac is what the iMac
    used to be. Basically, it's an easy-to-use, fairly inexpensive
    computer for users who don't need to do much besides word
    processing and accessing the Web.

"Subject: [SAtalk] O.T. Habeus -- Why?
","-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
 Hash: SHA1
 
 I may be dense, but why would anyone want to utilize Habeus?  To me, it looks 
 like a potential backdoor to anyone's defenses against spam.
 
 If I were a spammer, I'd simply set up a server, send out my spam with the 
 Habeus headers and continue till I was reasonably certain I'd been reported.  
 Then I'd simply reconfigure the server and reconnect to a different IP.  As 
 long as no one can establish my connection to the web sites my spam is 
 directing people to, I'm home free.
 
 Since I can set up spamassassin to I don't ""lose"" any email, what do I gain 
 by making it easier for spam to get through??

 Exsqueeze me, but what part of ""I don't know if it's true or not""
 did you fail to grok?  I personally doubt it simply because I never
 heard of Bush and Chirac going to Brighton.
 
 Next time I hear a joke, I promise not to laugh until I have checked
 out primary sources for confirmation in triplicate, OK?  Good thing
 we have you around to keep us on the straight and narrow, all the while
 inundating us with such erudite profundities as ""Kill your idols folks"",
 ""fight the powers that be, from with out and from with in"" and innumerable
 other dippy bromides.

 When I was in Omaha a couple of weeks ago, I made the 
 unfortunate mistake of driving through the intersection of 
 90th and Dodge. Those of you in Omaha know what sorts of 
 things I was muttering under my breath during the ordeal. Is 
 it possible to suffer from road rage when you're not moving? 
 Omaha has started a <a 
 href=""http://www.ci.omaha.ne.us/streets/restrictdate.asp"">10 
 year project</a> on Dodge street, which more or less divides 
 the city in half east to west. The traffic tie-ups due to 
 the construction disaster at 90th and Dodge are being felt 
 by nearby businesses. A <a 
 href=""http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/news/81302_bb1.html"">bank 
 is fighting back</a> in a creative way, replacing random $20 
 and $10 bills in their ATM machine with $50 and $20 notes 
 respectively to reward lucky customers for their patronage. 
 And I just drove right by the place.
 
 <p>The route to Des Moines from Waterloo isn't much better 
 right now as they widen highway 330/65 to 4 lane between 
 Marshalltown and Des Moines. Once that's done, it will cut 
 20-30 minutes from the trip, and judging from the progress 
 they've been making, it won't be too much longer. That's 
 probably the fastest moving highway construction I've seen 
 during my travels throughout Iowa over the years. As you 
 travel to <a href=""http://www.gnomedex.com/"">Gnomedex</a> 
 from all manner of locales, be sure to keep tabs on 
 construction at <a 
 href=""http://www.ctre.iastate.edu/iowaroadwork/"">this handy 
 site</a> put up by the Iowa Department of Transportation.

 <b>Iomega Intros 750MB Zip</b>
 
 <p><a class=""url"" href=""http://www.iomega.com/zip"">http://www.iomega.com/zip</a>
 
 <p>I've all but ditched Zip drive use entirely due to cost 
 and small capacity. I know many people that still use Zip 
 drives, and I still play with a 1GB Jaz drive from time to 
 time, but with the ease and low cost of CD-RW drives and 
 media, Zip just hasn't stood a chance. Now that Iomega has 
 bumped the capacity to 750MB, employed USB 2.0 and pushed 
 the speed of the drives significantly higher, maybe it's 
 still worth a look for those that need a fast removable 
 media option. I'll stick with CD-RW myself. I'll sacrifice 
 some speed for the reliability of optical media. But that's 
 just me.

 <b>Technical Overview of .NET File Services</b>
 
 <p><a class=""url"" href=""http://www.microsoft.com/windows.netserver/techinfo/overview/file.mspx"">http://www.microsoft.com/windows.netserver/techinfo/overview/file.mspx</a>
 
 <p>.NET Server is more than Windows 2000 with a look of 
 Windows XP, of that you can be sure. Common sense has 
 finally won, with the developers delivering many more 
 command line tools to manage core services. Of course, this 
 isn't the only thing being brought to the .NET table. 
 Improvements in DFS, defrag, chkdsk and EFS just scratch the 
 surface. New WHQL processes are being established for 
 antivirus products, allowing them to hook directly into the 
 OS. Virtual Disk Service, Volume Shadow Copy Service and 
 promised improvements in the File Replication Service should 
 make managing storage easier and more flexible.

 <b>P4 Performance Goes to Court</b>
 
 <p><a class=""url"" href=""http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,104075,tk,dn081602X,00.asp"">http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,104075,tk,dn081602X,00.asp</a>
 
 <p>A class action lawsuit has been filed in California by a 
 small group of PC owners that are miffed about the 
 performance, or lack thereof, that was promised by Intel, HP 
 and Gateway. Since the day the P4 was introduced, the 
 overall performance has been criticized, so this would seem 
 to be more an issue of failing to do proper due diligence on 
 the part of the customer, if you ask me. This is one of 
 those subjective questions that will come down to fancy 
 lawyers and luck of the jury pool draw. If they believed 
 everything the TV commercials had to say, then the litigants 
 got what they had coming. One beer tastes better than the 
 next, only one car can save your life in a crash, etc. This 
 general lag in P4 muscle has been publicized since day one, 
 as have crash test results on the part of the government and 
 third-party organizations. Should we be suing auto makers 
 when someone dies in a 5-star rated vehicle? That Volvo will 
 save your life, ya know. Does this set an unreasonable 
 expectation? Only if you consider advertising an education.

 Maxtor Driving Capacity-Centric Enterprise Apps With ""Super-Sized"" ATA Drives
 
 Maxtor Continues its Leadership in the Market it Pioneered with a New 
 Category of High-Density ATA Drives
 
 MILPITAS, Calif., September 9, 2002-
 
 Maxtor Corporation (NYSE: MXO), a worldwide leader in hard disk drives and 
 data storage solutions, today announced Maxtor MaXLineTM, its newest 
 generation of ATA drives designed specifically for rapidly emerging 
 enterprise storage applications including near-line, media storage and 
 network storage. The MaXLine family features two critical differentiators: 
 huge capacities up to 320 GB for corporate archiving and media recording; 
 and unique manufacturing and quality for 24/7 operations with mean time to 
 failure (MTTF) rates exceeding one million hours.
 
 The MaXLine family is designed to bring hard disk drives into ""near-line"" 
 archive applications. By adding a layer of MaXLine drives to archive 
 architectures, companies can instantly recover time-critical data including 
 executive e-mail, transaction data and accounting data that may need to be 
 recovered on demand.
 
 These new drives are designed to solve another enterprise problem with the 
 storage of video, media and audio conference call files. Even compressed, 
 these files take up tremendous amounts of high-cost server space. Priced 
 starting around $299.95 to $399.95 MSRP, Maxtor's MaXLine family offers 
 high capacity drives for enterprise applications at price points between 
 traditional ATA and SCSI drives.
 
 For system OEMs and white box builders, MaXLine offers high-density, 
 easy-to-integrate storage for use in entry-level and mid-size server 
 environments.
 
 ""The demand for instant recall of archived data is expanding as companies 
 are meeting their obligations to quickly access executive e-mails, 
 financial documents and transaction records,"" said Mike Dooley, senior 
 director of marketing for the Desktop Products Group at Maxtor. ""Users may 
 not need to access information in these applications on a daily basis, but 
 when they do need access, it must be instant. Recent advances in ATA 
 technology and our manufacturing processes allow us to build upon our 
 legacy of experience and provide our customers with a family of premium ATA 
 hard drives that can be integrated into a variety of systems for these 
 enterprise applications.""
 
 The MaXLine family includes the 5400-RPM MaXLine II, designed for 
 capacities up to 320 GB and the 7200-RPM MaXLine Plus II, designed for 
 capacities up to 250 GB. At these capacities, MaXLine offers higher storage 
 density than many tape and optical solutions. These drives have also been 
 tested and are projected to meet enterprise reliability requirements, 
 already exceeded by prior drives employing the same robust Maxtor designs, 
 which exceed MTTF of over one million hours. These drives will also carry a 
 three-year warranty.
 
 The MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus II feature the Maxtor Fast DriveTM 
 UltraATA/133 interface for data transfer speeds up to 133 MB per second. 
 The MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus II will be available with next-generation 
 serial ATA interface for higher performance. At 150 MB per second maximum 
 data transfer rate, serial ATA improves hard drive performance to keep pace 
 with the rapidly increasing performance requirements of data intensive 
 environments and enterprise applications.
 
 With a point-to-point connection architecture, and rich command set for 
 managing hard drive activity and data flow along the interface, serial ATA 
 advances the performance and efficiency of the drive to system interface. 
 The interface's reduced pin count allows for simpler cabling which in turn 
 allows better airflow within a system and further benefits the user with 
 increased design flexibility and hot plug capability.
 
 ""Maxtor's MaXLine family of drives provide a solution for storing data that 
 has previously been too expensive to keep on disk,"" said Dave Reinsel, 
 analyst at IDC. ""The ATA drives offer a great value, low cost per GB and 
 when integrated into storage systems and file servers offer a compelling 
 cost-effective alternative to tape libraries and optical drives, which have 
 been the traditional solutions used for near-line applications.""
 
 Availability
 Limited qualification units of the parallel ATA versions of Maxtor MaXLine 
 II and MaXLine Plus II are now available; with volume units available in 
 the fourth quarter. Qualification units of the MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus 
 II with serial ATA will be available later this month with volume shipments 
 scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2003.

 Eek.  Maybe it's just me, but I don't think that's a good idea. 
 Outputting a message in %post and providing a README of some kind would
 be better, as well as perhaps adding a note in %description.

","-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
 Hash: SHA1
 
 I know it's not the popular choice for a lot of people, but I'd
 suggest, um, church. :-). Like Woody Allen said, 90% of life is
 showing up, right?
 
 
 Almost anyone can find a church where the sermons don't make you bust
 out laughing, and you're set. I, for instance, am a Unitarian, which,
 as someone once observed, is merely a decompression chamber between a
 real church and a golf course. (ObUUJokes: Mid 70's bumper-sticker:
 ""Honk if you're not sure""; Lenny Bruce: ""Did you hear about how the
 Klan burned a question mark on the Unitarian's lawn?""; ""Unitarians
 would rather go to a discussion group about heaven than to heaven
 itself.""; ""Unitarians pray 'to whom it may concern'""; etc...)
 
 But, seriously, folks, my teenage-adopted denomination (I'm, um,
 lapsed, on several fronts, a Dutch-Reformed-turned-atheist father and
 an agnostic mother who used to be a southern Baptist of some stripe
 or another) and frankly limousine liberal secular-humanist
 congregation is about as orthogonal to my present
 congenital-Republican small-l libertarian turned anarchocapitalist
 politics as it is possible to be (except for the secular-humanist
 bit...), and I still go pretty regularly, though not as much as I
 used to. Heck, the older I get the less of the divine I believe in.
 I'm asymptotically approaching my father's atheism, these days, and I
 show up at least once a month. Nice folks though, when I can keep a
 civil tongue in my head -- smart too, when I can't and end up arguing
 with them. :-).
 
 
 Anyway, if *I* can end up hitched, anyone can. Talk about orthogonal.
 I met my practically-socialist state-education-bureaucrat wife one
 year after I started, moved in with her 6 weeks later :-), married
 her 2 years after that, and I wasn't even trying meet women. I was
 just looking to make friends as I was new in town.
 
 
 The trick to the church thing is, whatever denomination/congregation
 you end up in, expect to end up with a mate, not a date. I mean, some
 guys manage to stay single, but most, like me, don't. You can
 practically see the laser-sights light up when you walk into a
 room...
 
 That's because, of course, most churches are *run* by women. Most
 regular attendants are women. Hell, 65% of all new *ministers*, in
 protestant denominations, at least, are women. No matter your age,
 looks, intelligence, whatever, you'll end up surrounded by women.
 You'll be outnumbered, even several to one -- some of whom are at
 least better looking than you are. :-). The only place where there
 are *more* women running things is in grass-roots Republican politics
 - -- but I won't go there, I promise.
 
 
 If I may make a presumption here, since you brought it up, I figure
 that between the sophistication and diversity of the subcontinent's
 religions, and the ubiquity of Indians in various stages of
 assimilation in So/NoCal, you can find some place to hang out near
 you, Rohit. You probably don't even have to go, um, native, like I
 did -- backsliding on my own ostensibly rational godless upbringing
 and becoming, horrors, a Unitarian...
 
 Cheers,
 RAH

 Don't run SA on mails this large. Most people tend to ignore mails 
 larger than about 250K in spamassassin processing, because it just kills 
 performance. There are some known issues with the parsing (such as the 
 HTML parsing stuff which is much improved in 2.40 which we're soon to 
 release), but nothing that's too likely to be fixed by 2.40. Perhaps in 
 2.50 though.
 
 Matt.

 Here's a brief interview with me.  
 
     *Interviewer:* If the Boing Boing zine and blog were TV characters, who'd 
     they be, and how'd they get on? 
 
     *Mark:* The zine would be Jethro Bodine of ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" -- 
     curious, neophilic, xenophilic, gleeful, and eager to adopt any new theory 
     or conspiracy as the absolute truth. The Blog would be Sherman from 
     ""Peabody's Improbable History"" -- a traveler of time and space in search of 
     beauty, truth, and the outre. I think Jethro bOING bOING and Sherman Boing 
     Boing would be great pals. Jethro would invite Sherman's dog, Mr. Peabody, 
     to go raccoon hunting with him, and Sherman would send Jethro 40 years into 
     the future to hang out at the Playboy Mansion.

 Many of the essays in Oreskes' _Plate
 Tectonics_ seem to support this idea:

 ... and the Navy was in no hurry
 to declassify any of these data,
 as any uneven coverage could have
 revealed the parts of the oceans
 they found most interesting.
 
 -Dave
 
 (What do our seismic networks say
 about the middle east?  I hazily
 recall a story about LA reporters
 asking their local geophysicists
 about an early morning quake, to
 be told that, as far as could be
 figured, the ""epicenter"" was at a
 negative depth, travelling near
 mach speed, and presumably headed
 towards Edwards)",0,,,,

 why?
 
 or more specifically, what do you mean?  on one hand you can optimise
 how gcc is compiled.  all that will do is make it generate the exact
 same code just a smidge faster.  and since gcc is such a memory pig,
 you'd do better to buy more ram to up your fs cache hits and to keep
 gcc's heap out of swap.
 
 on the other side you can look into patches to gcc that affect it's code
 generation.  um, ok, but keep in mind that compiler errors suck. i can't
 express that enough.  compilers should just work.  perfectly. always.
 doing anything that might affect that is, in my opinion, insane. they're
 hard to trace and you'd better have a deep knowledge of what's going on
 to either report bugs to the patch developers or to fix it yourself.
 plus my understanding is that gcc would need major changes to get large
 speed boosts on x86 chips.

 Note that timtest.py's current tokenizer only looks at decoded text/* MIME
 sections (or raw message text if no MIME exists); spammers could put
 megabytes of other crap before that and it wouldn't even be looked at
 (except that the email package has to parse non-text/* parts well enough to
 skip over them, and tokens for the most interesting parts of Content-{Type,
 Disposition, Transfer-Encoding} decorations are generated for all MIME
 sections).
 
 Schemes that remain ignorant of MIME are vulnerable to spammers putting
 arbitrary amounts of ""nice text"" in the preamble area (after the headers and
 before the first MIME section), which most mail readers don't display, but
 which appear first in the file so are latched on to by Graham's scoring
 scheme.
 
 But I don't worry about clever spammers -- I've seen no evidence that they
 exist <0.5 wink>.  Even if they do, the Open Source zoo is such that no
 particular scheme will gain dominance, and there's no percentage for
 spammers in trying to fool just one scheme.  Even if they did, for the kind
 of scheme we're using here they can't *know* what ""nice text"" is, not unless
 they pay a lot of attention to the spam targets and highly tailor their
 messages to each different one.  At that point they'd be doing targeted
 marketing, and the cost of the game to them would increase enormously.

 Quod erat not demonstrandum at all.
 
 There are massive amounts of libraries for C, Fortran and so on.
 To pick an obvious example., if you want to do linear algebra, then
 Java isn't a serious candidate at all.
 
 Furthermore, plenty of bugs occur in the libraries too, at a lower
 rate due to more users having been bitten by them, but they are much
 harder for you to fix than in your own code.
 
 Why do so many people outside of Sun's marketing department consider
 Java to be ""Write Once, Debug Everywhere"" ?

 Good for you! You did the world a favor. Personally,

"Subject: Re: bad focus/click behaviours
","It's all here in these 10 lines, otherwise known as the
 ""I'll try my damnest to paste something"" procedure:
 
 # Return the current selection (from any window) or cut buffer 0.
 proc Text_Selection {} {
     if [catch {selection get} sel] {
         if [catch {selection get -selection CLIPBOARD} sel] {
             if [catch {cutbuffer get 0} sel] {

             }
         }
     }
     return $sel
 }
 
 This is in textSelection.tcl, and is what exmh uses to find text to paste.
 It is that last ""cutbuffer get"" that is wacky, because exmh sticks its
 own deletions into that little know stash, and is probably the only
 application on the planet that still looks there.  We should probably
 just disable that - try this variant:
 
 proc Text_Selection {} {
     if [catch {selection get} sel] {
         if [catch {selection get -selection CLIPBOARD} sel] {
             return """"
         }
     }
     return $sel
 }
 
 Everything funnels through here, so you just need to hack this one spot.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------=20
 =20
   On the occasion of the Veuve Clicquot Gold Cup Polo in West Sussex,=20
 Naomi Hancock reveals Veuve Clicquot's communication strategy.=20
 =20
 Veuve Clicquot has had a single consistent communication strategy in the=20
 UK for the last 15 years. This has been to associate the brand with the=20
 most glamorous sporting cultural and social events of the English summer =
 -=20
 known locally as The English Season.=20
 
 Veuve Clicquot has become the Champagne of the Season. We've adapted our=20
 communication to stay at the forefront of fashion, and attitudes to these=
 =20
 events, which combine tradition with the excitement of world class sport.=
 =20
 
 
   Does your company consider sponsorship a key marketing/communication=20
 tool?
 
 Absolutely. Sponsorship enables us to build positive associations for the=
 =20
 brand. But we are not interested in tacking our name onto an event where=20
 the addition does not add real value to the event and vica-versa. We=20
 believe in investing, nurturing, and improving over time.=20
 
 
   Can you describe your sponsorship strategy?
 
 We aim to maximise the perception of Veuve Clicquot as the Champagne of=20
 the Season. Everything we do is designed to build a partnership, and=20
 enhance the valuable efforts of our partners, in their own creation, and=20
 development of their events. Our buzz word is integration, as we seek to=20
 make The Season central to our marketing mix.=20
 
 
   Can you describe your sponsorship decision-making process?
 
 We usually discuss a sponsorship programme for the full year with our=20
 mother company in France. We have flexibility - within our budget and the=
 =20
 frame of The Season - to undertake what we sense to match our values and=20
 the image of Veuve Clicquot. Our role in London is to screen whatever=20
 comes to us and discuss relevant operations internally.
 
 We have a dedicated PR Group at Veuve Clicquot which makes all decisions=20
 related to our sponsorship. Above a certain threshold our head-office wil=
 l=20
 like to be involved in such a decision.=20
 
 
   What are the main criteria on which you base your sponsorship strategy?
 
 Return on investment is the key criterion for any marketing investment=20
 decision. We would only undertake sponsorship in Season-related events.=20
 This is our rule and frame of investment.
 
 
   What objectives are you seeking to achieve through sponsorship?
 
 Within the Season, we are especially looking to achieve visibility vis-=E0=
 -
 vis our audience, image-transfer, media coverage (all national press,=20
 magazine of all kinds).=20
 
 Awareness is also key for Veuve Clicquot, so we look to find events that=20
 complement those that we already have, and extend our appeal to people of=
 =20
 similar status, but differing interests.=20
 
 
   Please describe one of your sponsorships
 
 The Eighth Annual Veuve Clicquot Gold Cup Polo, held this month at Cowdra=
 y=20
 Park in West Sussex, is the largest entertainment operation undertaken by=
 =20
 Veuve Clicquot UK each year. This successful sponsorship earns Veuve=20
 Clicquot tremendous media coverage, fabulous exposure to our core target=20
 group and a perfect image transfer as polo is the sports of kings and the=
 =20
 king of sports.
 
 
   What's your approximate sponsorship spend per year?
 
 Significant. Without giving figures, we can say that we spend a large=20
 portion of our communication in sponsorship and support and that we=20
 organize the majority of our communication around the theme of Veuve=20
 Clicquot as the Champagne of the Season, because this is where we are=20
 getting a good return on our investment.
 
 
   How do you measure the effectiveness of your sponsorship?

"Subject: [ILUG-Social] URGENT ASSISTANT NEEDED
","Dear friend,
 
 I am Mrs. Sese-seko widow of late President Mobutu Sese-seko of Zaire, now known as Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). I am moved to write you this letter. 
 
 This was in confidence considering my present circumstance and situation. I escaped along with my husband and two of our sons James Kongolo and Nzanga out of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to Abidjan, Coted'ivoire where my family and I settled, while we later moved to settled in Morroco where my husband later died of cancer disease. However, due to this situation we decided to change most of my husband's billions of dollars deposited in Swiss bank and other countries into other forms of money coded for safe purpose because the new head of state of (Dr) Mr Laurent Kabila has made arrangement with the Swiss government and other European countries to freeze all my late husband's treasures deposited in some european countries. 
 
 Hence, my children and I decided laying low in Africa to study the situation
 till when things gets better. Like now that president Kabila is dead and the son taking over
 (Joseph Kabila). One of my late husband's chateaux in Southern France was confiscated by the french government, and as such I had to change my identity so that my investment will not be traced and confiscated.I have deposited the sum Eighteen Million United State
 Dollars (US$18,000,000,00.) With a security company for safe keeping. What I want you to do is to indicate yourinterest that you can assist us in receiving the money on our behalf, so that I can introduce you to my son (Kongolo) who has the out modalities for the claim
 of the said funds. I want you to assist in investing this money, but I will not want my identity revealed.I will also want to acquire real/landed properties and
 stock in multi-national companies and to engage in other safe and non-speculative investments as adviseby your good self. May I at this point emphasize the high level of
 confidentiality, which this upcoming project demands,and hope you will not betray the trust and
 confidence, which I repose in you.In conclusion, if you want to assist us, my son (Kongolo) shall divulgeto you all briefs regarding this project, tell you where
 the funds are currently being maintained and also discuss remuneration for your services.For this reason kindly furnish us your contact information,that is your personal telephone and fax number for validation purpose and acknowledge receipt of this mail using the above email address.
 
 Yours sincerely,
 
 Mrs. Mariam M. Seseseko.

 My French is a bit iffy these days, but if this is true, does it not also
 nullify Microsoft, Adobe and WinZip licences amongst most others? These all
 claim no liability, no guarantees (M$ say delivered ""with all faults"", so
 at least they are honest).

 It was clear you were talking about averages. But it should 
 be equally clear that that isn't what people mean when they
 use the word ""promiscuity"".

 Not at all. There are still people who only have one partner.
 There are many more whoe only have one partner over ""long""
 periods of time. So it is far from ""vacuous"" to describe some
 people as ""promiscuous"" and others as ""not promiscuous"", 
 especially over a set period. (""He was promiscuous in college.
 He is no longer promiscuous."")
 
 The word has a clear meaning, despite your continuing tendency 
 to gloss that meaning over with population averages.

 OK, then. Consider a population of 1,000,000. 500,000 men each
 pair off with 500,000 women. Then, 1 man, let's call him ""Wilt"",
 also has sex with the other 499,999 women. 
 
 499,999 women have had more than one partner. 499,999 men have
 only had one partner. It is now ""perfectly obvious"" that in the
 common meaning of the term, among this contrived population, 
 that women are ""more promiscuous"" than men -- even though the
 single ""most promiscuous"" person, Wilt, is a man.  
 
 ""Promiscuity"" is not ""exactly, perfectly identical between males 
 and females"", except under a degenerate custom definition of
 ""promiscuity"".
 
 > >unless ""promiscuity"" is defined uselessly.
 > 
 > Ain't nothin' useless about averages.
 
 Averages are useful, sure -- but much more so if called by their 
 actual name, rather than conflated with another concept.

 my local ISP works great with my iMac. I don't know what you guys

 anything else.

"Subject: [ILUG] serial port transient failure
","Here's a weird and wacky problem:
 
 I'm currently out of the country with my trusty Evo N600c laptop. When I 
 tried to use the serial port to talk to my mobile phone, Linux behaved 
 pretty much as if the port was fried. Bizarre, I thought, because I'd 
 used it successfully while in the office. The only difference was that I 
 was trying the thing in the hotel. I entertained brief notions of having 
 somehow fried the serial drivers, then rebooted the laptop to Windows 
 and tried again. Worked perfectly. Back to Linux. Still not talking. 
 Considered that it might be flaky power, so I ran the laptop on battery. 
 Nope. Tried moving the laptop to a differnet part of the room where 
 there might be less bogon flux. Still not working. Eventually I gave up 
 and used the IrDA port instead - which is usually the serial connection 
 of doom, grief, and teeth-grinding.
 
 This morning, in the office, the damn thing is working without a hitch.
 
 Anyone like to suggest what mystery technology is in use in the hotel 
 that prevents serial ports from working under Linux?
 
 Cheers,
 Waider.

 from razor.  Including the sample-spam.txt's from spamassassin 2.41, 2.31,
 and 2.20.
 
 Any suggestions?  thanks.

 *Motions Filed in Morpheus Peer-to-Peer Case
 Judge to Consider Legality of Gnutella Software
 
 Los Angeles - Attorneys for StreamCast Networks, developers of the
 popular Morpheus peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing software, filed
 briefs in federal court on Monday seeking a ruling that distribution
 of the software does not violate copyright law.
 
 Morpheus is a popular file-sharing application based on the
 decentralized Gnutella P2P networking protocol.
 
 In their briefs seeking summary judgment, attorneys from the
 Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and the law firm of Brobeck,
 Phleger and Harrison argued that distribution of the software is legal
 because the product is capable of substantial noninfringing uses and
 because StreamCast cannot control the various uses of the software.
 
 Supporting StreamCast in the motion is nine time Grammy nominee Janis
 Ian, who believes that peer-to-peer software represents important new
 opportunities for artists.
 
 On October 2, 2001, 28 of the world's largest entertainment companies
 sued StreamCast for the allegedly infringing actions of users of its
 product (MGM et al v. Grokster et al, Case No. 01-CV-8541 SVW).
 
 Additional briefs will be filed in the months to come, with oral
 arguments set for December 2, 2002, before U.S. Federal District Court
 Judge Stephen Wilson in Los Angeles.

 *Electronic Frontier Foundation Holds Second Annual Share-In
 John Perry Barlow, Mountain Girl Garcia Host Free Music Fest
 
 San Francisco - Join the Electronic Frontier Foundation and five Bay
 Area bands for an afternoon of live music and outdoor fun at EFF's
 second annual Share-In. The festival will be held in Golden Gate
 Park's Music Concourse Bandshell on Saturday, September 14th from noon
 - 5pm. The celebration of independent music will be hosted by Grateful
 Dead lyricist and EFF co-founder John Perry Barlow and former wife of
 the late great Jerry Garcia, Mountain Girl Garcia.
 
 Artists participating in this event will permit recording of their
 performances by those in attendance in support of EFFs Open Audio
 License (OAL). Musicians performing at the event include: the Box Set
 Duo - clown princes of folk-rock, the classic funk band Funkmonsters,
 celtic world-fusion group Hy Brassyl, harmony based folk-pop band
 Atticus Scout, and Berkeley-based party band Shady Lady.
 
 In addition to music, the Share-In will feature performers including
 Ashley Foster the One Wheeled Wonder, the Existential Circus,
 Frantastic Hands, the Metronome Dancers, and Willy Bologna and his
 Sideshow Circus. Bring your family and friends!
 
 Ben and Jerry's will sell their famous ice cream, and Cartwheel
 Catering will be on site with hot dogs, pretzels, and churros.
 
 Proceeds from the Share-In will go directly to EFF's Campaign for
 Audiovisual Free Expression (CAFE), which oversees projects such as
 the Open Audio License. CAFE empowers the creative community in
 cyberspace by protecting the public's access to and use of audiovisual
 technologies.
 
 The Open Audio License is a tool that EFF has developed in order to
 help artists share music more directly with their fans, without
 sacrificing recognition for their creativity. The OAL encourages
 collaboration, providing artists with an alternative to a business
 model strictly driven by profit. Based on the open source and free
 software initiatives for software development, the OAL encourages
 artists to share with one another and their fans
 
 Adoption of the OAL does not mean that artists go unrewarded for their
 work. On the contrary, the OAL permits artists to share single tracks
 or performances and gain widespread recognition for their work without
 relying on intermediaries. EFF encourages new models of music
 distribution in the digital world that benefit the artists themselves.
 The Internet makes it possible to drastically reduce the overhead for
 packaging and distributing music, which is where record companies
 currently spend most of the money that could be going to artists. EFF
 is committed to developing tools that empower artists to take control
 over their own art and to be compensated appropriately for their works.
 
 When: Saturday, September 14th, Noon-5pm
 
 Where: Music Concourse Bandshell in Golden Gate Park, near the
 Japanese Tea Gardens between MLK Drive and JFK Drive

 <p align=""left""><font size=""5"">T</font>he Wall Street Bulletin believes 
 that the <a href=""http://moneycentral.msn.com/content/P26293.asp?special=msn"">recent 
 investment of capital into Level 3, lead by Warren Buffett</a>, 
 is further proof of the continued validity of the telecommunication 
 market when looked at from the perspective of the small to mid-sized 
 enterprises. After the boom and bust comes the revival. For some 
 carriers drowning in debt, such as Global Crossing and WorldCom, 
 the future may be dim. But for those survivors of the industry 
 that have managed to remain on their feet, other companies' problems 
 mean opportunity. &quot;Every major industry in the history of 
 the United States has experienced a similar transformation, from 
 the railroads in the late 1800s to the automakers in the mid-1900s 
 to the Dot-Coms at the end of the 20th century,&quot; says <a href=""http://www.commweb.com/article/COM20010403S0001"">Robert 
 Saunders</a>, director of the Eastern Management Group market 
 research firm. <a href=""http://www.eftia.com/about/exec/dean.html"">Christopher 
 Dean</a>, CTO of OSS company Eftia, says &quot;We are seeing all 
 the people that are the survivors. There's all this pent-up money 
 and for the surviving carriers out there, they can get what used 
 to cost a few billion for a few millions.&quot; <em>Read the full 
 story from Telecommunications Magazine - See the link at the end 
 of this newsletter.</em> </p>
 <p align=""left"">As we write this report, our New Recommendation 
 InDigiNet, Inc. (<a href=""http://moneycentral.msn.com/scripts/webquote.dll?ipage=qd&Symbol=igtt&SUBMIT1=Go"">OTCBB: 
 IGTT</a>) has only been trading on the OTC Bulletin Board since 
 late May of 2002. As InDigiNet, Inc. continues to implement its 
 business plan, we believe this company will help lead the way 
 up for the resurgence of the Telecom Sector. This could be our 
 strongest recommendation of the year. We are giving IGTT our Highest 
 Rating of STRONG BUY/AGGRESSIVE GROWTH.</p>
 <p align=""left"">&nbsp;</p>
 <p align=""center""><strong>Ground Floor Opportunity / Tremendous 
 Growth Potential </strong></p>
 <p align=""left"">We believe IGTT will perform equally to, if not 
 greater than its competition. A similar telecommunications company, 
 Talk America Holdings (Nasdaq: TALK), <a href=""http://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/quickchart/quickchart.asp?symb=talk&sid=0&o_symb=talk&freq=1&time=7"">share 
 price began to explode in April of this year moving from just 
 over $0.40/share to over $4.00/share in late June</a>. Talk America 
 Holdings previously had a market cap of only $24.51 million, but 
 today has a market cap of $267 million.</p>
 <p align=""left"">IGTT curently has a market cap of $22.42 million. 
 Using the TALK model for potential growth, IGTT could very well 
 be trading in the .60 range in only a few months, with a market 
 cap in excess of $250 million. This would be an increase of 1000%. 
 So you see why IGTT has such great potential and the time is right 
  for investors to get in on the ground floor.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p align=""center""><strong>The <em>InDigNet</em> Strategy</strong></p>
 <p align=""left"">InDigiNet, Inc. is an integrated solutions company 
 that provides small to mid-sized enterprises (SMEs) with an integrated 
 communication solution. InDigiNet is a prestigious <a href=""http://tools.thestreet.com/tsc/quotes.html?pg=qcn&guid=%7B35CA79AF-6477-4734-90E1-97EC3455E773%7D&symb=igtt&sid=692861&orig=1&timer="">&quot;Diamond&quot; 
 level partner of Avaya</a>, as well as a reseller for Cisco and 
 Compaq. The Company will offer data, local, long distance and 
 wireless services to SMEs over third party networks enabling the 
 Company to offer a comprehensive suite of services without the 
 capital burden of building a communication network. The Company&#8217;s 
 strategy is to acquire the customer bases of smaller, single market 
 communication companies and attractively priced <a href=""http://webopedia.com/TERM/I/ISP.html"">Internet 
 Service Providers </a>(ISPs). <em>The Company recently completed 
 its acquisitions of Fox Telecommunications and WBConnect</em>. 
 InDigiNet will then expand the breadth of their services to grow 
 revenue and enhance profitability. SMEs account for $120 billion 
 in commercial telephony, data services and technology spending, 
 or 33% of the country&#8217;s total market, and this spending 
 is expected to grow at above average rates over the next ten years.

 <p align=""center""><strong>The<em> </em>IT Market</strong></p>
 <p align=""left"">Based on recent studies, the country&#8217;s 7.4 
 million SMEs currently lag significantly in the utilization of 
 <a href=""http://webopedia.com/TERM/I/IT.html"">IT</a> and data 
 communications, including Internet access, web services, business 
 software and e-commerce. Worldwide IT spending increased to $981 
 billion US for the year, an overall increase of 3.7 percent over 
 2001, according to a study released 7/24/2002 by market researcher 
 IDC. IT spending in 2003 is expected to reach record heights, 
 growing by 9 percent worldwide to top the $1 trillion mark for 
 the first time. In IDC's revised forecasts for IT spending in 
 2002 and 2003, IT spending in the US is expected to increase by 
 3 percent this year over 2001 to $436 billion, with further growth 
 of 9 percent in 2003. Western Europe can expect growth of 4 percent 
 in 2002 and 6 percent in 2003. Though Japan will experience flat 
 growth levels this year, by next year growth in the market will 
 return to the tune of 7 percent with particular strength shown 
 in China, India, Korea, Russia, the Philippines, South Africa 
 and Poland. <em>Source: <a href=""http://www.idc.com/en_US/st/aboutIDC.jhtml;jsessionid=2J2GJSTTFNK4MCTFA4FCFGAKMUDYWIWD"">IDC</a></em></p>
 <p align=""left"">&nbsp;</p>
 <p align=""center""><strong>Particulars</strong></p>
 <p align=""left"">The Wall Street Bulletin is putting IGTT on our 
 Strong Buy/Aggressive Growth recommendation list for the following 
 reasons:</p>
 <p align=""left"">1. The Company's strategy is to acquire the customer 
 bases of smaller, single-market communication companies and attractively 
 priced Internet Service Providers (ISPs). The Company will sell 
 its bundled service package to the acquired customer base that 
 will form a direct and immediate distribution channel for all 
 types of communication services - local, long distance, wireless, 
 and data. </p>
 <p align=""left""><br>
 2. The Company is currently serving many customers in the Denver/Front 
 Range communities but in particular the education vertical market 
 has recognized the value of integrating a wireless broadband data 
 network into the existing campus network. The Company's customers

 3. The Company has identified approximately $35,000,000 in revenues 
 to acquire comprised of distressed assets to be auctioned in bankruptcy 
 court and smaller communication providers with valuable customer

 <p align=""center""><strong>Investment Consideration</strong></p>
 <p align=""left"">InDigiNet Inc recently filed its 10QSB, for the 
 three months ended March 31, 2002. IGTT reported Revenues of $339,694 
 in Q1 2002 vs. Revenues of $0 in Q1 2001. At this current growth 
 rate, revenues should grow above $1.3 million for their first 
 year of production with no increases in acquisitions. As more 
 and more large corporations come under government scrutiny, investors 
 will turn to small to mid-sized companies with their investment 
 dollars. </p>

"Subject: [Spambayes] understanding high false negative rate
","[Jeremy]
 > The total collections are 1100 messages.  I trained with 1100/5

 While that's not a lot of training data, I picked random subsets of my
 corpora and got much better behavior (this is rates.py output; f-p rate per
 run in left column, f-n rate in right):
 
 Training on Data/Ham/Set1 & Data/Spam/Set1 ... 220 hams & 220 spams
       0.000   1.364
       0.000   0.455
       0.000   1.818
       0.000   1.364
 Training on Data/Ham/Set2 & Data/Spam/Set2 ... 220 hams & 220 spams
       0.455   2.727
       0.455   0.455
       0.000   0.909
       0.455   2.273
 Training on Data/Ham/Set3 & Data/Spam/Set3 ... 220 hams & 220 spams
       0.000   2.727
       0.455   0.909
       0.000   0.909
       0.000   1.818

       0.000   2.727
       0.000   0.909
       0.000   0.909
       0.000   1.818

       0.000   1.818
       0.000   1.364
       0.000   0.909
       0.000   2.273
 total false pos 4 0.363636363636
 total false neg 29 2.63636363636
 
 Another full run with another randomly chosen (but disjoint) 220 of each in
 each set was much the same.  The score distribution is also quite sharp:

 It's hard to say whether you need better ham or better spam, but I suspect
 better spam <wink>.  18 of the 30 most powerful discriminators here were
 HTML-related spam indicators; the top 10 overall were:
 
         '<font' 266 0.99
         'content-type:text/plain' 275 0.172932
         '</body>' 312 0.99
         '</html>' 329 0.99
         'click' 334 0.99
         '<html>' 335 0.99
         'wrote:' 381 0.01
         'skip:< 10' 398 0.99
         'python' 428 0.01
         'content-type:text/html' 454 0.99

 Sounds like you're solving the wrong problem.  If untrusted strangers
 are relaying spam through your qmail server, it's a fair bet that
 you've seriously botched your qmail config (like forgetting to create
 an rcpthosts file or something).
 
 Anyway, if you insist on using razor to resolve this problem, I
 would suggest tossing qmail-scanner <http://qmail-scanner.sf.net/>
 and SpamAssassin <http://www.spamassassin.org/> into the mix as well.
 The former provides the qmail-integration framework on which the latter
 does its work (including razor-check invocations).
 
 Fair warning: It'll be far more resource-intensive than simply denying
 relaying privileges to everyone except the folks you trust.  To find
 out how to do that, go to <http://www.qmail.org/> (which, incidentally,
 should be your first stop for all things qmail) and search for ""qmail
 newbie's guide to relaying"".

 I'm using RedHat 7.3 kernel 2.4.18-3, and glibc 2.2.5

 I might try downloading OpenOffice instead if it is

 I've never heard of any CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive having problems with DMA...
 although there probably is since Red Hat decided to default disabling it a
 few releases back :-/
 Normally, even if you try to enable DMA and your device doesn't support it,
 it simply don't be able to make the change, and that's it. The problem IIRC
 is with crappy hardware that is supposed to support DMA but doesn't work as
 expected when it's enabled... maybe Chris could confirm this? ;-)
 
 I guess I'll settle for the /dev/dvd link change as described and putting
 the DMA tip in the %description :-)

 > * Strengthened nonproliferation efforts to prevent rogue states and

 Assuming it's my fault (which it probably is since nobody else has really been 
 in there), it's most likely related to the number of sequences in a folder.  
 I'd guess that something is either being called that shouldn't be or is being 
 called more times than it should be.

 Not that I'm aware of.  If you look in the code, there are various places 
 where the time function is called in order to see how long it took to do 
 things.  You'll probably want to borrow that technique.

 Of course was genetic engineering. It used the fundamental mechanism of 
 genetics (inheritance of traits), and not randomly, but 
 intentionally--breeding for long fur, fat hams, whatever. The degree to which 
 the engineers--farmers, breeders--understood exactly how the mehcanism works 
 is only marginally relevant to the question of whether it was engineering. 
 Science progresses. Over the years, centuries, their, our, knowledge 
 increased, and domestication became more effective. Bit by bit the mechanisms 
 became known--Mendel making a major breakthrough. The first hybrid grains 
 (which date from the 1920s) represent another step. Watson and Crick another, 
 etc. But it's engineering--just as Roman architecture was civil engineering, 
 even if they knew less about the mathematics behind it than we do today, just 
 as Galen was a physician, though laughably ignorant by our standards.

 ""big bucks""...and this is one of those times. Why
 continue to pay more than is necessary and
 continue to let future savings slip away?
   
 We're a national mortgage provider. We're NOT a
 broker. As such, we can guarantee you the lowest
 possible rate and the best possible deal but only
 if you act NOW.
  
 There is no charge, cost or obligation to see if
 this opportunity meets your needs. You can easily
 determine if a new loan makes sense for you, and
 exactly why, because we provide only ""easy to
 understand"" quotes (in ""layman's terms"", in other
 words).
  
 We offer primary and secondary home loans and we
 will be happy to show you in ""black and white""
 why your existing loan is the best for you or why
 you should replace it. Of course, there's no cost
 to you at all to share your time with us. None. 
 
 Take 2 minutes and use the link below that works
 best for you. For 2 minutes of your time, we'll
 show you how you can save you and your family
 ""big bucks"" today. This is a once-every-30-years
 opportunity. So don't delay and ""miss the boat"".
 Act now.

 It was a crushing blow to discover that <a 
 href=""http://www.cnet.com/software/0-3227852-1204-9931175.html"">Vindigo</a>, my
 all-time-favorite Palm app, was no longer free. Twenty-five bucks
 wasn't steep, but the principle of paying for a former freebie
 was hard to swallow. Not that hard, though; surprising
 myself--and my fellow cheapskates--I've discovered that I'd
 rather dish out the dough than go Vindigo-free myself.

 That's what Web-based e-mail providers are banking on. Now that
 most of us have gotten sucked in by those gratis Web e-mail
 accounts, most ""free"" Web e-mailers have started charging for
 premium services or imposing strict limitations on free accounts.
 Read our <a 
 href=""http://home.cnet.com/software/0-3227888-8-20089773-1.html"">reviews</a> 
 of the four top services to see what you get if
 you dish out the dough (or not)--and which to avoid if you want
 to stay spam-free.

 Surfacing on this week's Buzz Meter is another free-gone-fee app.
 The latest version of the popular file-sharing software BearShare
 now offers a paid version that lets you search and download
 without those annoying ads. Maybe the best things in life are now
 those with a fee.

 <font size=""-1"">Yahoo now charges for services that were once free; Hotmail
    dumps accounts without so much as an explanation. So-called

 I hate to put it first, but unfortunately, all other

    fourth week as front-page news, WorldCom woes continue to sap

 This new version of the well-known peer-to-peer

 Check your local friendly Red Hat installation:
 
 [root@localhost up2date]# rpm --checksig zsh-4.0.2-2.src.rpm
 zsh-4.0.2-2.src.rpm: md5 gpg ok
 
 Of course, this is only as useful as, say, the gpg keys distributed with 
 the Kernel tarballs, i.e. if you don't actually bother checking the sig 
 then you are open to abuse. It's entirely possible that rpm can be 
 configured to require good signatures, but I've not read that part of 
 the fine manual just yet.

"Subject: RE: Secure Sofware Key
","the only way to insure a safe key is to use all the storage space in the
 universe. too big to decrypt.
 
 my point is there will never be a ""safe"" key. what I would consider is how
 long does the data need to be protected. if you need to protect the data for
 longer than 6 months, do not release it to the public. if you are trying to
 stop the general public (your customer) from coping the data then use what
 is available on the market. If you want to stop the bootleggers do not
 release the data to the public.
 
 I have never seen a lock that could not be unlocked. the act of unlocking
 the key gives away it's secret.
 
 the tougher the lock the more pissed-off your customers will be. take MS-XP
 for example. only the home user is forced to register. think of the
 nightmare if business had to register every copy. how many times have we
 needed to reinstall our laptop OS? notice the amount of Mac's sold after the
 XP release. these where mostly home users that converted to Mac OS.
 
 the new Audio CD's that have digital copy protection so not play on my
 computer. does this stop me from copying the CD? no. however it does make me
 return them and get my money back.
 
 the more popular the software the more likely it is to be cracked.

 Unfortunately, there are few comments in this part of the code.  I haven't 
 been helping that situation much, although there are some comments in the new 
 sequence stuff that I wrote.  I have cleaned up a bit of code so that 
 it's a little more clear what it's doing and a little less delicate.  I also 
 gratuitously renamed some variables for clarity.
 
 My last few bug fixes were purely problems that I created in my own 
 patches and I can't blame anyone but myself.
 
 As I'm avoiding real work, I may clean up a little bit more (and probably 
 break a few things as well ;-).
 
 Chris

"Subject: Re: Fw: Re: When are we going to get. [making ALSA rpms]
","Thanks for this information.  I gave Alsa a try, couldn't figure out how
 to enable digital out, although I'm sure if I put enough time into it,
 could have gotten it working.  Also when playing mp3s in analog mode,
 every time I switched between mp3s there was a bit of static.  Noticed a
 new distribution geared towards audio applications, AGNULA
 (http://www.agnula.org/) uses Alsa as well.  Seems though the latest
 open source emu10k1 drivers (SBLive! 5.1) work fair enough.  Anyone else
 experience these problems with Alsa?  Are there alot of people on this
 list using Alsa?
 
 Regards,
 
 Lance

 All it takes is an overtorqued nut (e.g. at the water intake entrance)
 to stress the porcelain, and you've got a time bomb waiting to go off.
 Of course, if you're lucky, you'll overtorque it enough that the tank
 will break right away, while you still have the water intake shut off.

 I have a working apt 0.5.4cnc7 package for Red Hat Linux 8.0. It will be
 available at the same second the distribution will, and so will a complete
 apt repository already including quite a few of my packages updated for Red
 Hat Linux 8.0.
 
 I didn't want to say all this before Monday, but as the new release already
 leaked from many places, and official statements made about it, it
 shouldn't be a big deal :-/
 
 I'll keep you all posted on Monday! They'll even be a big apt-related
 surprise! ;-))))

 IIRC, if the query string contains
 
 varname=FIRST&varname=SECOND
 
 then PHP will create a variable called ""varname"" with result SECOND. 
 However, if the query string contains
 
 varname[]=FIRST&varname[]=SECOND
 
 then PHP will create an array with varname[1]==FIRST and varname[2]==SECOND
 
 There are other ways to get the data from the HTTP request, and I guess 
 I'll do that if it turns out to simplify the script that creates the 
 form; but as i understand it that's the ""official"" way to get data from 
 a SELECT MULTIPLE using PHP.

 ""x"" is fine, but let's not take out the config option.  if people really
 want to have it be something else, we shouldn't hinder them.

 Well, that's one of the 10 rpm-related mails leftover in my inbox I just
 mentionned privately ;-)
 As it's a big piece and needs some testing, I'm just bit lazy about it :-/
 
 I'll try to packages it asap, or at least put up a ""testing"" version first
 in case I fear some imperfections.

 END OF LIST OF FIVE NAMES*********************
 
 Step 2.  These Guides will be emailed to you.  Save these
 Guides on your computer's hard disk as other people will be
 ordering these Guides from you, paying you for them and
 you will need to email the Guides to the new buyers.
 
 Step 3.  From the list of names above, delete the name and
 address of the person shown under GUIDE#5, and replace that
 slot with the name and address of the person from GUIDE #4's
 slot.  Be sure to copy the name and address exactly as shown.
 Check the address again.
 
 Step 4.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #4, and
 replace with the name and address from GUIDE #3's slot.
 
 Step 5.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #3, and
 replace with the name and address from  GUIDE#2's slot.
 
 Step 6.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #2, and
 replace with the name and address from GUIDE #1's slot.
 
 Step 7.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #1, and
 replace with YOUR OWN NAME AND ADDRESS. This
 step is how your own name and address is entered into the
 list of names to receive orders for the Guides. Eventually,
 your own name will go down the list of names until you have
 reached GUIDE #5, and then be dropped from the list. The
 key point is that the number of people ordering Guides from
 you will grow larger the lower down the list your name goes.
 
 Step 8.  Once you have completed this new list, send out
 this new email (which shows your name under GUIDE #1) to
 as many email addresses as possible, as many as 100,000
 emails or even more.  The greater the number of mailings
 you make, potentially the greater the number of people who
 will order the GUIDE #1 from you.  These people will then
 make new emails to send out to their addresses with the email
 showing your name under GUIDE #2, and so on.
 
 This is all you need to do.  If you wish to read the rest of
 this email message, then do so.  If not, just do the 8 steps
 shown above. Remember, the key point is to send out as
 many emails as possible in step 8, and to encourage and help
 those who purchase the Guides from you to send out
 emails of their own.
 
 Do NOT change anything other than what is instructed.
 Because if you do, it will not work for you.  Your immediate
 reaction might be: Why not replace all the names on the list
 with the names of your spouse, kids, relatives, and friends.
 That might seem to you like a clever move because new
 buyers will be sending their money to these people.  But
 that move is the exact opposite of what is to your benefit.
 What will benefit you most is having people who will send
 out emails, seek new buyers, and provide assistance to new
 buyers. If the people you slip into that list aren't going to
 be sending new emails, you're only hurting yourself by
 effectively closing down the program with your name on
 top of the list of the names that you have inserted.  There
 wouldn't be new buyers coming in. So, your sly maneuver
 will gain you exactly zero!  Furthermore, if you have done
 the work, and your name has worked its way to further
 down the list, by then you deserve the rewards and
 earnings from that effort, and it would be unethical for
 anyone to remove your name for whatever reason.  Don't
 do it to others. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!
 
 You may have a concern that after sending the total $50 to
 the five people on the list that one of the people will just
 take your money, and not send you the Guide.  Well, rest
 assured.  As we said above, it's to our benefit to have you
 as a satisfied buyer who will actively send out emails to find
 new buyers.  So don't think the people on the list will try to
 cheat you or to ""stiff"" you for $10.00.  The people on the list
 would rather have you working hard because your effort will
 benefit them as well as you.  Later on, when other buyers send
 you the order to buy the Guides, fulfill your end of the deal
 by sending the ordered Guide to the buyer.  Don't cheat.
 Provide efficient and honest service and we will all benefit.
 ******END OF SUMMARY************************
 
 =======REST OF MESSAGE======================
 
 With easy-to-use email tools and opt-in email, success in
 this business is now well within the capabilities of ordinary
 people who may not have done any internet marketing before.
 And the earnings potential is staggering!
 
 READ THIS EMAIL TO THE END! -
 follow what it says  - and you will not worry whether a
 RECESSION is coming or not, or whether or not you can
 afford to buy that new car or home that you have been
 looking for.  Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never
 responded to one of these before either. One day though,
 something made me feel: ""You use $50 going to a movie
 for 2 hours with your spouse, friend, or child, plus a simple
 meat at a restaurant.  Why the heck not?""  No matter where
 you believe those ""feelings"" came from, I thank every day
 that feeling came over me.
 
 I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be doing
 had I not. Read on. It works.  And when you read the Guides,
 Youll learn how to become a more effective communicator.
 What can be better?  A way to improve your self-image and
 confidence and at the same time have the potential to recover
 your investment and make some good money: making over
 half a million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home.
 If you work on this program, you will learn a lot about direct
 marketing on the internet.  If you believe direct marketing
 via the internet is the way sales and marketing will be done
 in the future, then the experience you will gain here could
 be a real boost in your work career, possibly even providing
 a new career for you.
 
 = PRINT THIS MESSAGE FOR FUTURE REFERENCE =
 
 If you want to make serious money, read this message until
 you understand it completely and feel confident to follow
 through on what it advises.
 
 FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION ABOVE AND
 YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS CAN COME TRUE!
 
 Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it,
 it will NOT work!  This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You
 are offering a product for sale to a buyer. Treat it as such
 and you can see money coming to you  in a reasonable period
 of time, depending on the collective efforts of yourself and
 the others on the list of five.
 
 ===========================================
 *** Take this entire email, with the modified list of names,
 and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER
 CHANGES.  There are 2 methods to get this venture going:
 
 METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK EMAIL LEGALLY
 ===========================================
 
 Let's say that you start small, to see how it goes, and that
 you and those involved send out only 5,000 emails each.
 Let's also assume that the mailing receives only a 0.1%
 (1/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better
 but let's just say it is only 0.1%). Also many people will
 send out hundreds of thousands of emails instead of only
 5,000 each.
 
 Out of your 5,000 emails and a 0.1% response, that is only
 5 orders for Guide # 1. Those 5 people who responded also
 send out 5,000 emails each for a total of 25,000. Out of
 those 25,000 emails only 0.1% responded with orders.
 That's 25 people who responded and ordered Guide # 2.
 
 Those 25 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
 125,000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is 125 orders
 for Guide # 3. Those 125 people send 5,000 emails each
 for a total of 625,000 emails sent out. The 0.1% response
 is 625 orders for Guide # 4.
 
 Those 625 people send out 5,000 emails each for a total
 of 3,125,000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is  3,125
 orders for Guide # 5, or $31,250 at $10 per Guide.  This
 may seem a small amount to you, but remember we used a
 very low response rate with a small number of emails being
 sent out.  See what happens if you can get the response rate
 up just slightly.
 
 If Response Rate is 0.1%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:
 $50+250+1,250+6,250+31,250 = $39,050 (as above)
 
 If Response Rate is 0.15%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:
 $75+560+4,220+31,640+237,300 = $273,795
 
 If Response Rate is 0.2%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:
 $100+1,000+10,000+100,000+1,000,000 = $1,111,100
 
 Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone
 or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
 emails each or more?  From the example above, you can see
 the power of leveraging, that is, how much greater is the
 amount of money from a small increase in the response rate.
 
 There are over 200 million people on the internet worldwide
 and counting, with thousands more coming online every day.
 
 METHOD # 2: PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
 ===========================================
 
 Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are
 Many FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on
 the internet will get a response. We strongly suggest you start
 with  Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you go along.
 For every $10 you receive, all you must do is email the
 Guide the buyer ordered. Always provide same day service.
 
 The people you buy these Guides from will assist and advise
 you how to get the large number of email addresses that
 you need to send the new email containing your name and
 address.  In return, when others buy the Guides from you,
 you also should help those buyers to resell the Guides to
 their email addresses.  This will benefit you because your
 name would be further down the list, and their new buyers
 will buy from you.  This is no different than ""customer
 service"" in the retail or the  ""bricks and mortars"" business.
 
 ===========AVAILABLE GUIDES ==============
 The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is illegal or
 somehow  ""wrong"". It is simply about time. Time for checks
 or credit cards to be cleared or approved, etc. Concealing it
 is simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope
 and steal it before it gets to you.
 
 ORDER EACH GUIDE BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
 Always send a single $10 bill (U.S. CURRENCY) for each
 Guide.  Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is hidden
 by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of
 those sheets of paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME
 of the Guide you are ordering, YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS
 and your name and postal address.  Be sure to address the
 envelope correctly and put the proper amount of stamps to
 mail the envelope.
 
 PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE GUIDES NOW
 FROM THE NAME AND ADDRESS LIST SHOWN
 AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS EMAIL
 ________________________________________________
 YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES
 
 === If you do not receive at least 10 orders for GUIDE #1
 within 2 weeks, continue sending emails until you do.
 
 === Two to three weeks after you receive 10 orders,
 you should receive 100 orders or more for GUIDE #2. If
 not, continue advertising or sending emails until you do.
 
 Once you have received 100 or more orders for GUIDE # 2,
 YOU CAN SEE THE PROGRAM IS WORKING, and
 cash should continue coming in! THIS IS IMPORTANT
 TO REMEMBER:  Continue to assist new buyers with advice
 and instruction on how to send out more emails. You can
 KEEP TRACK of progress by noting which guides people
 are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE
 MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF EMAILS
 AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN.
 There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate !!!
 ===========================================
 A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:
 You have just received information that can give you
 financial freedom to really change your life, but I don't
 wish to kid you:  This requires A BIT OF EFFORT. You
 can make more money in the next few weeks and months
 than you have ever imagined. Follow the program
 EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED.
 
 Remember to email the revised copy of this email after you
 have put your name and address in GUIDE#1 and moved
 others to #2 .....# 5 slots as instructed above. One of the
 people you send this to may send out 100,000 or more
 emails and your name will be on every one of them.
 Remember, the more you send out the more potential
 buyers you will reach.
 
 IT IS UP TO YOU!  ORDER THE GUIDES NOW AND
 EMBARK ON THE ROAD TO FINANCIAL SECURITY!
 
 Upon your purchase of any GUIDE #1 through #5, the
 Copyright owner assigns to you two important rights:
 (1) The right to resell and to distribute via the internet the

 is reserved exclusively for the copyright owner.  Your right to
 resell and to distribute copies of the GUIDE applies only to the
 internet and/or world wide web via electronic distribution.

 Do you feel capable of writing such a tool?  It doesn't look too hard.

"Subject: Re: making rpms from already-compiled source trees
","Well, thanks everyone for the explanations. I still disagree with the 
 reasoning, but it seems this is one of those philosophical questions 
 that I'm on the losing end of :)
 
 The checkinstall utility that someone mentioned seems useful, but I 
 don't really have the time to figure it out right now. After searching 
 the web some more, I found out that Mandrake's version of rpm is 
 patched to support what I wanted. So I guess I'll look into that when 
 I get a chance.

 As far as I can tell, this could be useful for my situation too. It's 
 not a complete solution since I can't really distribute the SRPMS with 
 full certainty that they work, but at least I can make RPMS for local 
 use by tarring up the buildroot directory and then using the above 
 technique. All I really want is to get dependency tracking for 
 everything installed on my system (including software from cvs). This 
 just makes it a little bit faster.

"Subject: JavaServer Pages updated
","Filled with useful examples and the depth, clarity, and 
 attention to detail that made the first edition so popular 
 with web developers, the just-released ""JavaServer Pages,  
 2nd Edition"" (Bergsten, $44.95) is completely revised 
 and updated to cover the substantial changes in the 
 1.2 version of the JSP specifications, and includes 
 coverage of the new JSTL Tag libraries--an eagerly 
 anticipated standard  set of JSP elements for the tasks  
 needed in most JSP  applications, as well as thorough 
 coverage of Custom Tag Libraries.  
 
 What people said about the first edition:
 
 ""an excellent printed resource on JSPs...I have 
 been extremely impressed by its depth, clarity,
  and attention to detail. ""

 Smallest files are listed first with the largest at the end. So if
 you want to get the 5 largest files, pipe through tail.
 
 e.g.
 
 $ find /dir -name \*  | xargs du -s | sort -n | tail -5

 The first two are wrong. The first amendment DOES
 protect speech the Supreme Court decides it protects
 (duh!), and that happens to include most of what
 people consider hate speech. Unlike many other
 nations, the US has no laws against hate speech, per
 se. And the first amendment is the reason for that.

","Is there a way to get my read email downloaded off webmail.eircom.net.
 
 I've been reading the emails using the web based interface. But I've
 reached my quota limit. There doesn't seem to be any way to get the
 emails off the server. I can connect to the account using POP, but that
 only retrieves unread emails. There's also no way to mark emails as
 unread from the html interface.
 
 Is there a way I can use fetchmail perhaps to get it to pull down all
 the emails and remove them off the server.
 
 It's been years since I've used fetchmail, I don't recall be able to do
 this.
 
 Any other suggestions welcome. There's a few hundred email so I don't
 fancy going through each one forwarding it to another account.

Subject: dvd::rip on Red Hat 8.0?,"Hello,
 
 Has anyone made a working source RPM for dvd::rip for Red Hat 8.0?
 Matthias has a spec file on the site for 0.46, and there are a couple of
 spec files lying around on the dvd::rip website, including one I patched
 a while ago, but it appears that the Makefile automatically generated is
 trying to install the Perl libraries into the system's, and also at the
 moment dvd::rip needs to be called with PERLIO=stdio as it seems to not
 work with PerlIO on RH8's Perl.
 
 Not too sure what the cleanest way to fix this is - anyone working on
 this?
 
 Thanks,

"Subject: Best news yet
","INVESTMENT SCHOLARS CLUB- bringing you the latest from the financial epicenter. 
 
 Research Alert - Undervalued
 August 26, 2002
 XrayMedia
 (OTCBB: XRMD) Alert Rating = 8
 
 Congratulations to our subscribers who moved in fast on our last report! 
 
 Pick #1 - Internet incubator giant CMGI has paid off very well, up over 150% on major volume and great news.
 
 Pick #2 - ENBC Began its' heavy move up over 200% hitting a high of over 300%... 
 
 Our Latest Discovery: XRMD - Several investment reporters featured XrayMedia during fiscal 2001/02. At the time, we felt that the advertising industry created a huge opportunity for the company's direct sourcing technology solutions, and so far the company has delivered. Although the company has raised just $2 million in the two years it has been developing its technology, it has increased revenues sources dramatically by opening a financial services division expanding the Live Media Marketplace expected revenues to $3-5 mm during fiscal 2003, driving the line in 2004 to $15- 25 mm. This remarkable growth becomes more understandable when one views the savings that its direct sourcing model generates for advertisers and retailers. The company saves advertising buyers up to 70% in costs dramatically increasing wholesale pricing effect, by saving time & efforts, cutting telephone and faxing bills, while providing free mass sourcing opportunities for negotiating advertising buying and selling opportunities using a secure state of the art real time negotiating technology over the Internet, weve never seen anything like it!
 
 How does the company do this? 
 
 XrayMedia (OTCBB: XRMD) The Company founded XrayMedia in March 2000 to create a ""mass source to advertising sector "" live negotiating technology and advertising purchase financing accents the companys strengths, serving both large and small United States and International customers with advertising opportunities delivered directly from the media and the general public. *** With the use of proprietary software, it is providing sophistication to this industry which greatly expedites orders and finds opportunities based on the users criteria which results in a savings to the advertising buyers and as well as the ad sellers which it serves. 
 
 Their ""source to business model"", eliminates two levels of hindrance (sourcing and limited opportunities) and provides its customers with mass advertising choices and live negotiating that is designed give a substantially low cost base for finding the right advertising opportunity for all business with no cost.
 
 While investors have thrown money recklessly at money-losing technology companies, here is a company that will increase revenues from $1 to $25 million in three years, and grow profitability substantially with little funding. XrayMedia is among the best performing sectors since September 11th, and we feel that XrayMedia is likely to break through its 52-week high of $00.19 soon.
 
  *** Listed on the OTCBB and trading with an extremely low market valuation under 10 mm.
 
 *** It has opened accounts with over hundreds of buyers and sellers including some of the largest media buyers in the world, major retailers and smaller retailers. 
 
 *** Attracting interest of major investment bankers and analysts, also a possible acquisition target at some point by major retailers.
 
 *** Received largest order of advertising financing over $500k with more contracts accumulating.
 
 *** Revenue growth is expected to be dramatic $1mm to $5mm. 
 
 *** The company is expected to report a profitable quarter, to grow revenues and earnings ""substantially"" when it begins its 2003 fiscal year in January.
  
 Shares Outstanding:      	83 mm

 Not knowing one whit about elliptic curve math, can you provide 
 some expert interpretation of these results?
 
 It looks like the old record for, say, 199 bits, has been
 blown out of the water by a factor of ~100,000.
 
 Does this mean that Eliptic Curve encryption is
 now easily breakable? Or faster than before with
 no loss in strength? Or stronger?
 
 Raw bits are OK, cooked bits are better.

 At the 1993 ITAC ""Roadwork"" Conference, Peter Mansbridge asked the
 panel of experts how it might be possible to censor the internet.  All
 of the panelists laughed except Bill Buxton.  Peter asked him if he
 knew something the others didn't.  Bill replied that it /was/ possible
 to censor the internet, which drew a gasp from the audience. ""All you
 need is a global government more Draconian than any that has occured
 before in history""
 
 Scientology DMCA suits against Norwegians, legal RIAA file-trading
 virii, Bush's Homeland Insecurity, Canada using ISPs as spies, RIAA
 suing Prodigy for P2P users and having Foreign sites barred from the
 US, France tempers Yahoo, China IP-filters Google ... 
 
 Seems Bill didn't know much about how Government really works.  Either
 that, or there's a smelly similarity between Buxton's global Big
 Brother and the US and Chinese.

 Don't run SA on mails this large. Most people tend to ignore mails 
 larger than about 250K in spamassassin processing, because it just kills 
 performance. There are some known issues with the parsing (such as the 
 HTML parsing stuff which is much improved in 2.40 which we're soon to 
 release), but nothing that's too likely to be fixed by 2.40. Perhaps in 
 2.50 though.

 I dunno, BB.  Women who like to be thought of this way should have the
 right to choose to be treated this way.  Men too...  ahem.  (:  My boy
 cleans, washes clothes, cooks, fixes stuff, etc, and works the same number
 of hours I do, sometimes more, if he has to catch up with me.  (:  I
 close him because he is industrious and creative, and because he
 unfailingly makes my bed the minute I get out of it.  And boy #2 will be
 here soon to help boy #1 with other things such as pedicures,  backrubs,
 and sure, fucking.  LOL! (along with the aforementioned ""chores"") Adam can
 have his cake and eat it too, if he can only find the right girl who has
 the same beliefs about gender  roles that he has. Of course, he has NO
 clue where to look, so we will be constantly laughing at him while he
 stumbles around in the dark.

 P.S. the numbers do not in any way indicate importance or favor -- only
 the order in which they move into my house.  -smiles at chris-
 P.S. #2.  I'm moving.   Going to New Orleans.  Can't handle any more cab
 driving.  The summer sucked here on the MS Gulf Coast, instead of rocking
 like it normally does.  Wish me luck.  I'm going to look for another
 computer job.  Le Sigh.  (:

 You seem not to know what a ""poor man's divorce"" is.
 It is an old term, from the time when divorce was
 difficult, but walking was easy, and identity was
 not so locked down as it is today. Not every widow
 had a dead husband.
 
 >I'm seeing lack of innovation ..
 
 That doesn't tell us anything except what is
 happening in Eugen Leitl's life. The more common
 observation is that the rate of change is increasing.
 Do you have any data that might persuade us that what
 you see is more telling than what others see?
 
 >gerontocracy favors gerontocracy.
 
 I would have thought that gerontocracy favors biotech
 research and plenty of young workers to pay taxes.
 Note that the fertility rate doesn't result from
 decisions made by the old, but by the young. If we
 want more kids, we have to convince people who are
 in their twenties to become parents.

"Subject: [ILUG] PCTel modules
","Hello again. I tried all the suggestions for the PCTel driver and at the end of it, everything still goes smoothly until I type ""make"" after I get the output from the ./configure. 
 
 However, there were a couple of things I noticed along the way. After typing 
 * cp configs/kernel-2.4...config .config
 * make oldconfig
 * make dep
 The 2nd to last line I got back said that the modversions.h file was not updated. When I looked at this path to the modversions.h file, it was 281 lines and every line started with a # mark. Is it the case that nothing is read on a line after a # mark (or am I just thinking of another language?) and so should I delete the # at certain places?
 
 Also, when I was in the pctel directory and typed ""make"", I noticed that a different subdirectory is taken to a different modversions.h file. Inside this other file, there's nothing at all. And so I moved the modversions.h file with 281 lines to the empty modversions.h file - and got a different reply after ""make"". The output after I moved the file over mostly looked like this:
 /usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:11:33: linux/modules/adb.ver: No such file or directory
 /usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:12:37: linux/modules/af_ax25.ver: No such file or directory
 /usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:13:36: linux/modules/af_ipx.ver: No such file or directory
 
 The odd lines being the path and the first half of the other lines are what's written after the # in the modversions.h file. Should there be a file at each of these (one at each of the 281 lines of the file) that I'd have to compile/make?
 
 It's taken plenty of elbow grease, but I'm glad it hasn't gone smoothly, it's a good learning experience. Again, any help is appreciated. Thanks, Eric

 And it is pretty common practice in some environments with public 
 workstations to just wipe and re-install Windows machines on a weekly 
 (or even daily) basis. It's easier than trying to maintain Windows.

 I'm gonna fix this one. I think the best solution will be to copy the modified 
 rules to blib and install them from there. Then the rules files will be 
 changed on build time and not install time, too.

"Subject: RE: [SAtalk] user_prefs ignored
","This is just an semi-educated guess - if I'm wrong, someone please correct
 me!
 
 Spamd setuid's to the user running spamc. Since you're calling spamc from a
 global procmailrc file, it's being run as root (most likely). If called as
 root, spamd won't open user_prefs files.
 
 >>From the spamc man page:
 
        -u username
            This argument has been semi-obsoleted.  To have spamd use
            per-user-config files, run spamc as the user whose config
            files spamd should load.  If you're running spamc as some
            other user though (eg. root, mail, nobody, cyrus, etc.)
            then you can still use this flag.
 
 
 The solution is to set DROPPRIVS=yes in /etc/procmailrc, just before running
 spamc. From the procmailrc man page:
 
        DROPPRIVS   If set to `yes' procmail will drop all privileges
                    it might have had (suid or sgid).  This  is  only
                    useful  if  you  want  to guarantee that the bottom
                    half of the /etc/procmailrc file is executed on
                    behalf of the recipient.
 
 
 I hope that helps, and I also hope it's right!

 | Hi All,
 |
 | I am running SpamAssassin 2.41 with procmail as my local delivery agent
 | with sendmail.  I use spamc/spamd so that it runs site-wide from
 | /etc/procmailrc.
 |
 | spamd is run as root with the flags ""-d -a -c"", and spamc isn't run with

 |
 | When I was testing the program, I deployed spamc from my personal
 | ~/.procmailrc file, my ~/.spamassassin/user_prefs file was read each time.
 | I can see this because I have a non-default ""required_hits"" value which
 | gets reported in every e-mail on the ""X-Spam-Status"" line.
 |
 | Now that I run spamc from the global /etc/procmailrc file, my
 | ~/.spamassassin/user_prefs file is no longer being read or processed from
 | e-mails from outside computers.  The ""required_hits"" value gets set back
 | to the one in /etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf.  However, if I send local
 | e-mail, my user_prefs file is read and processed correctly.
 |
 | Does anyone know how to fix this problem?  if this is a spamassassin or

 I did that yesterday, but seems like nobody bit.  Just in case <wink>, I
 uploaded a new version just now.  Since MINCOUNT went away, UNKNOWN_SPAMPROB

 Scripting languages allow rapid development of game behavior without the 
 pitfalls that await the unwary C++ programmer. Using an existing scripting 
 language saves the time and cost of developing a custom language, and typically 
 gives you a far more powerful language than you could create on your own. 
 Python is an excellent choice for a game scripting language because it is 
 powerful, easily embedded, can seamlessly be extended with C/C++ code",0,,,,

 I view IMAP as a stop-gap measure until tighter integration with various email clients

 I still feel it's better to require classification feedback from the recipient, rather than

 The Disappearing Alliance
 By Dale Franks 10/08/2002
 
 
 For over two generations, the countries of Western Europe have been our
 closest allies. We stood beside each other through the darkest days of the
 Cold War as partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. We
 celebrated with them over the fall of the Soviet Empire and the liberation
 of Eastern Europe from the yoke of communism.
 
 Tragically, a generation from now, we may be bitter adversaries.
 
 Europe has increasingly fallen under the spell of a political ideology that
 Hudson Institute scholar John Fonte has termed ""progressive
 transnationalism"". The key doctrines of this form of post-communist
 progressivism contain some fairly pernicious ideas. Among these are the
 deconstruction of nationalism, the promotion of post-nationalist ideas of
 citizenship (i.e. a ""global"" citizenry), a redefinition of democracy, and
 the pooling of national sovereignty into multinational groups such as the
 United Nations.
 
 The European Union, itself a multinational organization built through the
 pooling of sovereignty by European nations, is post-democratic. While there
 is a European Parliament, the EU's power resides mainly in the unelected
 European Commission (EC) and its unelected President, who face few limits
 to their power. Instead of a limited, consensual form of government, where
 elected representatives promulgate constitutional laws, the EU has an
 appointed, oligarchic executive, along with a large attendant bureaucracy,
 whose orders are not constitutionally limited in any real sense. Moreover,
 the EU has been unwilling to accept the democratically expressed wishes of
 the people themselves when those wishes conflict with the results desired
 by the EU's political elite. Both the EC and the European Court of Justice
 regularly overturn the national laws of democratically elected EU member
 governments. This is a step backward in Europe's political development.
 
 European criticism of America is on the rise, and the European list of
 complaints about America is a long and growing one. They dislike the fact
 that our republican system of government is not based on proportional
 representation. They hate the fact that our citizens own guns. They despise
 the fact that we execute murderers. They resent the fact that our economy
 is so large, and that Americans consume so much. They also resent?and fear
 - the fact that we have the ability to project American power anywhere
 in the world.
 
 On August 9, 2002, Adrian Hamilton wrote a column in the UK's Independent
 newspaper, in which he identified the US as a rogue state who should be
 restrained, perhaps by a European military invasion, followed by a decade
 or so of occupation. Fortunately, the article is satirical not because it
 exaggerates the way European progressives view the US, but rather because
 the impotence of European military power makes the idea of an invasion of
 the US literally fantastic.
 
 At least, for now.
 
 Despite the tongue-in-cheek nature of this editorial, however, the fact
 remains that America is increasingly viewed this way by the European
 intellectual and political elite.
 
 The Europeans actively desire a world where the United Nations keeps in
 check the activities of sovereign states. Because they have built such a
 system in Europe, they feel it's valid for the rest of the world. America,
 however, is the biggest obstacle to such a system. The Europeans cannot
 understand why America places a higher value on the ethos of national
 sovereignty and limited, consensual, and constitutional government, than it
 does on compliance with international ""norms."" They view all departures
 from such norms as aberrant. Because the UN member states all have an equal
 vote in prescribing international norms, they assume that, since the
 process is ostensibly legitimate, the results must be as well. The trouble
 with this idea, of course, is that it gives the views of non-democratic,
 authoritarian states the same weight as those of free, democratic
 societies. It sanctifies the process, with no regard to the actual results.
 
 Thus, they are unable to make any moral distinction between the US refusals
 to join in a given international effort because we wish to preserve the
 liberty of our citizens, and similar refusals from Iraq because its
 dictator wishes to maintain his firm grip on power. Our repeated references
 to the US Constitution, and our unwillingness to bypass its provisions to
 comply with international norms, are incomprehensible to them. They assume,
 therefore, that our refusal is based on arrogance, rather than on a
 commitment to
 constitutional rights.
 
 None of this bodes well for the future of Euro-American friendship, or
 cooperation. If the Europeans continue to reject traditional liberalism in
 favor of the new progressivism, their criticism of the US will rise, while
 their tolerance of our differences will fall. Obviously, in such a
 political atmosphere, the opportunities for conflict will inevitably
 increase.
 
 That thought is frightening enough. Even more frightening, however, is the
 thought that such a conflict might be averted by our own acceptance of the
 new ideology of transnational progressivism.

 It was a extreme contrived example because you glosded over the 
 point of the earlier 3-person example. 
 
 But OK, Mr Math, let it be N men and women, for any N>2. They 
 all pair off. Then, some number H, N>H>0, of men has sex with 
 all the other N-1 women he hasn't yet had sex with. 
 
 Pick any N and H that might be interesting. Any choice of
 values results in meaningful differences between the sexes' 
 ""promiscuity"", as commonly understood. It should be more 
 obvious with extreme choices of numbers, but it is also true 
 for any choice of N and H, if unrealistic totals distract you.
 
 Further, and I was hoping this would be clear without saying
 so outright, this model actually approximates the cliche 
 ""common wisdom"" about per-gender sexual behavior, if you 
 reverse the male and female roles.
 
 Those stereotypes are: that more men than women seek multiple
 partners -- men being ""more promiscuous"" than women -- and that 
 surplus of male interest is satisfied by a smaller number of 
 hyperpromiscuous women (often derisively labelled ""sluts"").

 Nope, now you've amended the meaning of your initial statement to
 make it more defensible. What I objected to was:
 
 Robert Harley:
 # >The assumption that females of all species tend to be less promiscuous
 # >than males simply does not fit the facts, Hrdy contended.
 # 
 # Well, DUH!!!
 # 
 # It is perfectly obvious that (heterosexual) promiscuity is exactly,
 # precisely identical between males and females.
 # 
 # Of course the shapes of the distributions may differ.
 
 If you assumed people on FoRK had a clue, would you have needed
 to jump in with a patronizing ""DUH!!""? 
 
 If you were talking about fuzzy, typical behavior, would you have 
 huffed and puffed with the words ""perfectly obvious"" and ""exactly, 
 precisely identical""? 
 
 If your concern was with the ""typical"", why didn't you adopt the 
 typical definition of ""promiscuous"", rather than a straw-man
 definition which allowed you to interject ""DUH!!"" and mock an
 anthrolopology professor's conclusions? 
 
 > Actually, you probably just

 You are welcome to that theory!
 
 But here's an alternate theory: when you jump in with a patronizing 
 and overblown pronouncement -- e.g. ""DUH!!... perfectly obvious... 
 exactly, precisely identical..."" -- and that pronouncement is 
 itself sloppy and erroneous, then others may get a kick out of 
 popping your balloon.

 How about enabling the ""Show unseen message count in folder cache""
 option? It displays the number of unseen messages next to each folder name
 (if greater than 0), so you don't really need the unseen window unless
 you're using more sequences than just ""unseen"".

 Defrosting the past
 
 Ancient human and animal remains are melting out of glaciers, a bounty
 of a warming world
 
 BY ALEX MARKELS
 
 As he hiked near Colorado's Continental Divide in the summer of 2001, Ed
 Knapp noticed a strange shape jutting from a melting ice field at 13,000
 feet. ""It looked like a bison skull,"" the building contractor and
 amateur archaeologist recalls. ""I thought, 'That's strange. Bison don't
 live this high up.' ""
 
 Knapp brought the skull to the Denver Museum of Nature and Science,
 where scientists last month announced that it was indeed from a
 bisonone that died about 340 years ago. ""This was an extraordinary
 discovery,"" says Russ Graham, the museum's chief curator, adding that it
 could alter notions of the mountain environment centuries ago. ""There's
 probably a lot more like it yet to be found.""
 
 And not just bison. Colorado isn't the only place where glaciers and
 snowfields are melting. Decades of unusual warmth in regions from Peru
 to Alaskaa trend some think is linked to emissions from cars and
 industryhave shrunk or thawed many of the world's 70,000 glaciers. As
 the ice recedes, a treasure-trove of human and animal artifacts is
 emerging, extraordinarily well preserved after centuries in the deep
 freeze. The fabrics, wood, bone, and DNA-rich tissue found on the mucky
 fringes of the ice are revising scientists' understanding of our
 predecessors' health, habits, and technology, and the prey they pursued.
 
 ""It's mind-boggling how many different fields are being advanced through
 studying these remains,"" says Johan Reinhard, a high-altitude
 archaeologist and explorer-in-residence at the National Geographic
 Society. Rare, spectacular finds like the frozen mummies he discovered
 in the Andes of Peru in the 1990s and the legendary 5,300-year-old ""Ice
 Man,"" found at the edge of a receding glacier in the Alps in 1991, have
 offered time capsules of cultural and biological information. Now, as
 the ice continues to retreat, it is yielding not just occasional
 treasures but long records of humans and animals in the high mountains.
 
 Vanishing act. The trick is finding such specimens before Mother
 Natureand looterstake them first. Once uncovered, frozen remains can
 deteriorate within hours or be gnawed by animals. Moreover, they're
 often so well preserved when they emerge that people who come upon them
 don't even realize they're ancient.
 
 That was the case when three men hunting sheep near a high glacier in
 British Columbia, Canada, three years ago saw what they thought was a
 dead animal. ""It looked a little like sealskin buried in the ice,""
 recalls Warren Ward, a teacher from nearby Nelson. ""But when I looked
 closer I could see leather fringe from a coat and finger bones.""
 
 Figuring they had found the remains of another hunter, or perhaps a fur
 trapper, the men stowed a flint knife and other artifacts in a Zip-Loc
 bag and delivered them to local officials. Archaeologists later exhumed
 the fallen hunter's body, along with a woven hat, fur clothing, and what
 seemed to be a medicine bag. Carbon dating revealed that the hunter
 lived about 550 years ago. Dubbed Kwaday Dan Ts'inchi, or Long Ago
 Person Found, by people of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations (who
 may be his direct descendants), he is perhaps the best-preserved human
 from the period ever found in North America.
 
 Other findings from melting ice in the neighboring Yukon region could
 explain what that long-ago person was doing in the mountains in the
 first place. ""Before this there was no archaeological record of people
 living here,"" says Greg Hare, a Yukon government archaeologist. ""Now we
 see that this area was very much part of people's seasonal activities.""
 
 Like Ward's discovery, the search began by chance, when Kristin Benedek
 caught a whiff of what smelled like a barnyard as she and her husband,
 Gerry Kuzyk, hunted sheep at 6,000 feet in the mountains of the south
 Yukon. They followed the scent to a melting patch of ice covered in
 caribou dung. ""It was really odd, because I knew there hadn't been
 caribou in the area for at least 100 years,"" recalls Kuzyk, then a
 wildlife biologist with the Yukon government.
 
 Caribou cake. Returning a week later, he found ""what looked like a
 pencil with string wrapped around it."" It turned out to be a
 4,300-year-old atlatl, or spear thrower. Further investigation of the
 ice patchand scores of others around the regionrevealed icy layer
 cakes filled with caribou remains and human detritus chronicling 7,800
 years of changing hunting practices.
 
 Scientists now believe ancient caribou and other animals flocked to the
 ice each summer to cool down and escape swarming mosquitoes and flies.
 Hunters followed the game. They returned for centuries and discarded
 some equipment in the ice. ""We've got people hunting with throwing darts
 up until 1,200 years ago,"" says Hare, who now oversees the research
 project. ""Then we see the first appearance of the bow and arrow about
 1,300 years ago. And by 1,200 years ago, there's no more throwing
 darts.""
 
 Now scientists are trying to make the search less a matter of luck. They
 are developing sophisticated computer models that combine data on where
 glaciers are melting fastest and where humans and animals are known to
 have migrated to pinpoint the best places to search in Alaska's Wrangell
 and St. Elias mountain rangesthe United States' most glaciated
 terrainand in the Andes. Johan Reinhard thinks the fast- thawing
 European Alps could also deliver more findings, perhaps as exquisite as
 the Ice Man. ""Global warming is providing us high-altitude
 archaeologists with some fantastic opportunities right now. We're
 probably about the only ones happy about it.""",0,,,,
